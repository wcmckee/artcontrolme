Taking an old pencil sketch into GIMP. The location is Courtney Place in Wellington.
Have been digitizing lots of Pepper and Carrot sketches so it has been a natural process to take my own pencil drawings into GIMP.

Grayscale layer. Whenever I use to digitize pencil work I would always create a grayscale layer. My favourite area is the traffic lights and the courte sign.

![coyrtney-color](/galleries/2016/08/18/coyrtney-color.png)

Colour layer. Using more green than I use to and in different areas such as the figure. Yellow is used for the buildings roof and walls. The floor and sky - blue.

I partook in a Twitter chat last week - [create lounge](http://www.createlounge.com/) and have started listening to the podcast. This was my warmup drawing in life drawing on Friday - I was listening to an episode.

Three drawings of Mia from life drawing on Friday. Included is a portrait of someone new I drew from the backgroup. Sometimes I wish we had multipy models!

Warmups of Mia. Attempted to capture the whole body. Needed to make sure that the portrait was small enough to fit everything else in.

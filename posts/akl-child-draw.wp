<html><body><p>Here are some recent traditional drawings.
It's been awhile since I have updated so this is somewhat of a bulk post.

This was drawn at Fairfield Community Centre. I have been really enjoying drawing spikes. Those sharp edges, getting them to look good.

Dolly drew this colorful character. I love the level of detail. Eyes with eyeballs, a mouth, hair, top (shaped beautifully). Arms. Though the left arm is very fat! Both arms are interesting and different. The fingers count to 5 on the right hand. Left hand has four fingers.

I sat at the Queen Street, Auckland Burger Fuel store with my sister and drew this. We ordered 'The Bastard' and shared it. Clouds and burgers were a focus. I copied logo and text from Burger Fuel.

This was drawn at Overload in Auckland. I used Horse Ninja postcard as reference.

Texture of colored pencil. Sitting on the concrete outside and making markings.

Amazing marks from the kids.

Plant in a tree, with a landscape at the bottom. Similar to the landscapes I draw.

Started with the robot and grew. Houses in the landscape, along with wild forests.

I did a drawing of Dollys tree inside a bubble. The brick wall at the base. I was drawing straight lines and not making them rugged. I was told this was wrong and that I should do it more ruged, like the original. I obeyed (and agreed).

Great shapes. We thought it was a snake at first but later relized there may be some rivers and boats happening. How exciting!

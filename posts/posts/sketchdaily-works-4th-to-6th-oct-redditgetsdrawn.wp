I've gotten good at recording all my painting I've been doing, editing and uploaded to Youtube, No sound on it because I'm not a sound person and don't have the time to do a narration to them all. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/sketchdaily-ekek.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1249" title="sketchdaily - ekek" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/sketchdaily-ekek-1024x640.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="365"></a>Merpeople was the theme for October 5th. I was inspired by my sister who often makes the noise Ekk Ekk. Being a fish. As always, spent time working on the background even more than the characters. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/sketch-daily-vat.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1250" title="sketch-daily - vat" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/sketch-daily-vat-1024x640.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="365"></a>October 6th.

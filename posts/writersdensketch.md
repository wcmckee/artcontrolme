![lvnbuild](/galleries/2016/01/24/lvnbuild.png)

This was originally a pencil drawing I did at Waikato Uni a few years 
ago. I took the original pencil sketch and traced over it - same 
technique I use to always do with my pencil drawings (only this time 
there is no grayscale and colour layers). 

![oldfoods](/galleries/2016/01/24/oldfoods.png)

This was created at WritersDenHamilton. The theme was to draw a place,
time, or setting and have others guess. This was the first thing I have 
written since the NanoWriMo in November. I wrote about a messy house.

![wdhpossessio](/galleries/2016/01/24/wdhpossession.png)

Drawn during WritersDenHamilton. Had a focus on author A.S. Byatt. I 
would like to read one of her books - Possession: A Romance was the 
recommended book. Need to get that ebook reader!
I like the idea of writing what is true.

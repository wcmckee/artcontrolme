<html><body><p>Back from Napier. Visited my Granddad. I had my laptop with me but no internet - I noticed several shops in the CBD that offered free WIFI. I didn't worry - instead spending the time offline on my laptop and watching CI, Sky Sports (cricket),One News and the horse racing with Granddad.


I got out each day and drew. Here are the street works from around Napier:

Square. I sat here several times and drew. This was a favorite piece of mine. I'm looking forward to taking it into GIMP and painting over it. With the line I attempted to create a range of marks in order to show the texture.

Waterfront. Sitting on a bench and looking South. It was beautiful weather - especially in the evening. This is the left side of the page... I continued it onto the second. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1672" alt="nap-e" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/nap-e-1024x744.jpg" width="584" height="424">



Plant in the foreground. I captured someone walking but - mostly to give proportion to the image. Thinking about it now - I really should of checked on life drawing classes. Oh well, I enjoyed the drawing on the streets. Plenty of people on the street that I was able to capture.

I sat near a car park and drew the church and plants across the road. They had a water fountain that I especially enjoyed drawing.

Less detail in this one - just quick<a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/sb-lvnpol.m.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1679" alt="sb-lvnpol.m" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/sb-lvnpol.m-1024x744.jpg" width="584" height="424"></a>



Before the trip. This was drawn in Levin.

This was a night drawing. I sat on a street that reminded me greatly of Cuba Street. Looking out towards where I walk to my Grandfathers home. It's quite the wak, but I got out at least once a day.



<a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/nap-draw-water.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1677" alt="nap-draw-water" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/nap-draw-water-744x1024.jpg" width="584" height="803">W</a>ater front drawing. I started with Gouache (work I'll post in a future post). People liked to come to the waterfront, many sitting and eating fish and chips. In this piece two figures sit and watch the hills<a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/nap-draw-landscape2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1678" alt="nap-draw-landscape2" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/nap-draw-landscape2-1024x744.jpg" width="584" height="424"></a>



Yet another waterfront drawing. One major difference I noticed with painting was the problem with catching small details - rather impressions of the area. I'll try to work with goauche more but /i do enjoy the life drawing to digital painting process.



 



I look forward taking these works into GIIMP.



More drawings and start posting paintings later.</p></body></html>

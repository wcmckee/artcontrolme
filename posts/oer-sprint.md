I have just spend the weekend in Wellington. I attended the 
first OERSprint. On Saturday a group of people came together 
to create open education resources for teachers. 

Here is the artwork that I created during the sprint and my 
time in Wellington:

A jazz band playing on Cuba Street. I drew this after the 
sprints finished on Saturday. They had attracted quite a 
crowd. It's moments like this I miss living in Wellington - 
the arts feel very much alive and happening.

Brain storming ideas for oersprint. Was taking ideas from others
in the room and getting them down. Allot of the time it was
just doodling, away in my world.

The headless figure in the bottom left catches my attention.

It's been a long time since I have done anything with the draft
novel I wrote in November. This is some artwork for it. The 
four planets/moon arguing about being blown up.

I had a great weekend drawing at Kiwijam followed by the wlug meeting on 
Monday night. Here is a bunch of drawings created at kiwijam, my brothers, and
wlug.  

![kiwijam-faceface](/galleries/2016/07/26/kiwijam-faceface.png)

Created several cartoon portraits then filled the page with landscapes.

![kiwijam-sunday](/galleries/2016/07/26/kiwijam-sunday.png)

Focused on the circles. Small and tiny to build up an area. Landscape of water
with a character at the bottom. Shapes rising up. 

![kiwijam-trumpstand](/galleries/2016/07/26/kiwijam-trumpstand.png)

Continued with Trump theme. Characters standing on top of a wall. Water below.


![kiwijam-windowwindow](/galleries/2016/07/26/kiwijam-windowwindow.png)

Character in a square frame with spikes emerging out. Another character drawn
on the bottom left, merging into the background.

Detail on the water. Normally don't use such a small line for it. 

![landscapewaves](/galleries/2016/07/26/landscapewaves.png)

These are all the same. What more can I say? 

![meetup-idea](/galleries/2016/07/26/meetup-idea.png)

Recently I founded several groups on meetup.com that were already happening irl.
These are Hamilton Computer Club and Life Drawing Hamilton. 

I am likely to build scripts in the future that automates actions on meetup. 
This is the start - reverse engineer the concept of meetup.com and rebuild it
as Nikola sites. 

![rgd-wtvhannah](/galleries/2016/07/26/rgd-wtvhannah.png)

Had a break from the usual imagination landscapes. Or as Bill told me 'doodles'.
It doesn't bother me, he teaches Microsoft focused Computer Science at a 
uni.

This was drawn from RedditGetsDrawn. wtvrmelon and hannahthepalindrome. Filled
the negative space around the portraits with squares and squiggles. 

![smallanimal-grayscale](/galleries/2016/07/26/smallanimal-grayscale.png)

Grayscale tonal layer of the following line work. Must of been getting sick
of drawing the imagination line pieces and created a grayscale tonal layer. 

![smallanimal](/galleries/2016/07/26/smallanimal.png)

I like the animal on the bottom left. 

![towerburst](/galleries/2016/07/26/towerburst.png)

Towers, rectangles to build a wall. Landscape.

![tweet-post](/galleries/2016/07/26/tweet-post.png)

Idea to modify the bot to tweet images. Currently it is only tweeting random
blog posts and would be easy enough to open those posts up and tweet the images/
content.

![wlug-x11](/galleries/2016/07/26/wlug-x11.png)

This was drawn at wlug. The topic was Wayland and Mir as replacements for X11.
I packed up the Pi after the talk but Ian did an excellent demo of Endless OS
which I didn't get to take notes on.

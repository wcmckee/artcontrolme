<html><body><p>I've been cooking (curries, and a cake), and giving the place a tidy, and slight move! Moved all my gear from the lounge to my bedroom - which is now taking a more computer and art studio setup. Works for me though. I haven't done any digital painting but have had a go with acrylic paint - on the walls.

I had no refernce or ideas - just going on the idea of an enviorment of some sort - maybe a landscape. Straight in with paint - drawing in lines - then covering in tone.

<div>My palette, old plate. Primary colors - yellow and blue have been used. About to do a layer of red, helps the highlights and the balance of greens and reds.</div>

<div>Basic idea, building up the marks. Large flat brush is used. Exploring ideas that I started with oil painting. Leaving areas. Filling areas. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/120811-230124.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-778" title="120811-230124" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/120811-230124.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768"></a>Character in the foregound. Great to have the room to develop a character and the enviroment around him. This is certainly a painting style that works for me.</div>

Very important. How else can he walk? The red in the background is a pillar the two characters are standing on - the the foreground area. Below is the forest and water. Travel on the pillar? <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/120811-230131.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-779" title="120811-230131" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/120811-230131.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768"></a>The corner. Lots of white space still. Needs reds and more blues.</div>

Using opposites works well.</div>

<div>Far right, The other edge of the painting. An oddly shaped mirror rests againist the wall. Several characters have been painting. Reference was me - a self portait! Interesting how the colors change on the surface - darker blue to light.<a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/120812-105329.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-783" title="120812-105329" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/120812-105329.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768"></a>It's a jigsaw. I can take pieces out and apply new pieces. This is a acrylic painting I did when I first moved back to Levin. A new layer has been added. Blues and reds. Blends into the wall.</div></body></html>

<html><body><p>So since being banned from posting on RedditGetsDrawn I decided to go ahead and make my own subreddit - artcontroldrawsyou.
I have been writing Reddit python scripts that gets data from one subreddit and posting the data to a new subreddit/saving the data.



I have also been getting back into doing tonal black and white/color digital works. These are not included in this post - but keep an eye out in future.

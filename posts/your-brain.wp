<html><body><p>In Wellington public library the otherday I came accross a recent book on creativity and such. It had some good ideas about exercising your brain for artists. Here are the rough notes I wrote into my book:
</p><h1>Right Brain</h1>

<h3>Go topsy turny</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Workupside down</li>
	<li>Turn an image 180 degrees</li>
	<li>Recreate using lines and shapes</li>
</ul>

<h3>Colour a word</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Write down a word representing a complex issue then translate it into a picture</li>
</ul>

<h3>Sing for spontaneity</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Sing out loud or repeat a 'mantra' of any kind</li>
</ul>

<h3>Imagine a photograph</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Choose a photo</li>
	<li>Identiy the primary shapes by outlining them with a marker.</li>
	<li>If you had to break it down to 4-5 shapes what would they be?</li>
	<li>Create a drawing or painting out of it</li>
</ul>

<h1>Left Brain</h1>

<h3>Be a critic</h3>

<ul>
	<li>The left brain is the inner critic</li>
	<li>Look at a piece of work by another artist. What are the strengths and weaknesses? What could be done to improve the message?</li>
	<li>Focus on techniques used and not just emotion</li>
</ul>

<h3>Applaud your supplys</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Start by looking at info on packaging then look up resources like manufactures websites and artists message boards.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Paint with words</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Chooses a painting and employ as many adjectives to it</li>
	<li>Have someone read what you have written and sketch it</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step it out</h3>

<ul>
	<li>List the steps you would take to re-create a famous work of art, whether the artist created it that way or not</li>
</ul></body></html>

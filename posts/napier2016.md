Drawings completed on my trip to Napier. Still using 7 inch tft with pi2b for 
these. Lost the screws for mounting the pi and touch screen. Brought some new
but they were m3 and i needed m2.5. Instead of the 7inch I've switched back to
an old 480px 320px touch screen. It has been hard to walk and draw with the 
7inch so looking foward to walking with the 3inch and comparing the difference.
Not drawing for some time also helps with motivation to draw well walking.

<html><body><p>Hi. I've been busy with unity3d but get in a pencil drawing now and then. I think I've lost my pen for my tablet. Its likely somewhere in my room. Looking on mightyape I see they have baboon tablets for 100 dollars - might be worth picking one up.
Anyway. Here's a pencil drawing I did recently:

The reference for this was a portrait photo on redditgetsdrawn.

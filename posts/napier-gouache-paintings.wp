Here are paintings I did from life during my time in Napier.

Everyday I went for a walk when I was in Napier. Majority of these walks were into town - to the waterfront. It was very hot during the day so the evening was the best time for me to be outside - it didn't get dark till late. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/draw-hello1.jpg">

I painted the same landscape multiply times - the view was South. This was one of my first ones - where I'm still warming up <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/draw-hello1.jpg">

This was one of my first paintings I did in Napier. I did this outside a suburbs shops - so not directly in town. The paper only handles one layer of paint - I really should be using thicker paper. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/draw-hello1.jpg">

My least favorite out of the lot.

Right side of the previous painting. Capturing the trees scaling into the foreground. A nice blue would help. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/draw-hello1.jpg">

</a><a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/nap-watercolor-street2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1691" alt="nap-watercolor-street2" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/nap-watercolor-street2-1024x744.jpg" width="584" height="424"></a>



One of the major differences I notice with painting is the lack of detail I'm able to get - with drawing I can capture small drawings - painting tends to be more of a impression. I think I will always enjoy drawing more. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/draw-hello1.jpg">

Another street view. Paints great with how quickly it spreads. Roger always said 'painting is easier because it spreads quickly' when comparing it to painting. Very true - I can cover more of a area with paint than draw and not get tired. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/draw-hello1.jpg">

This was a favorite landscape. The reds in the sea helps. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/draw-hello1.jpg">

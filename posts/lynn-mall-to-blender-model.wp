<html><body><p>I've been super busy in Blender. It's been a blast. <a href="http://www.polycount.com">PolyCount</a> has been a big inspration. I feel things are starting to move forward. This post shows a scene I worked on yesterday with building stairs and a hand rail - using Concept artwork I drew in Auckland. I want to model more of my works in Blender - my skills will improve!

The digital painting I used for inspration in the 3d work. I didn't copy it excatly but instead took the essence of it - the stairs, hand rail and pillar shapes. The scene developed as I worked on it - adding items that were not in the original scene. Creative freedom allows this! <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/lynn1pain.jpg">

Overall view of the scene - this was badly modeled and when it came to texturing it was a disastore. I used this as a first draft and remodeled the scene so I was able to texture it.

Same scene. This is the ground view. I wanted to hand paint the entire scene. I enjoy digital painting and UV painting is something I need to learn. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/power2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1156" title="power2" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/power2-1024x661.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="376"></a>The remodeled scene. I basically split the scene up into areas, in the first scene it was all one big mesh - here it's split into tiny meshes to work with - the floor - three walls - several cubes for the internal walls, and the stairs. I just re-added the power poles and made them a more interesting with tilting (notice right)

On the right is the power pole - I added several more polys to it. I think a texture will be best though.

Animation of the scene. I wanted to give first person a go. It would be super cool to add limbs and such to the first person view. So you felt you were really there. I read a great post on Reddit the other day discussing <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/zw3vu/why_do_developers_generally_not_like_to_implement/">Why do developers generally not like to implement feet and torso for 1st person view?</a>. I'll like to explore the first person view further.</p></body></html>

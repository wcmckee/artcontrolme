Here's a painting I did of Clem from the game:

And using some reference photos that I took recently I did this enviorment painting:

The second reference was from Auckland - the Sky tower. The rest of the image was just tone building up from imagination - including the mountain. I'll like to do more of these photo studies rather than just work from my drawings.



Finally here's the video for this these paintings -

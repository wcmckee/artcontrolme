Another week, another conference. This week I got along to WCELfest. It's an
digital elearning conference held at Waikato University. 

Here are the paintings that I created during the event:

Drawing and note taking of the beginning of the conference including the keynote
speaker - Terry Anderson. It was an excellent keynote. I especially enjoyed him
talking about copyright and open access. There was no mention of Creative 
Commons, but I was activly tweeting with mentions of Creative Commons.

This was the final image of the day. I had grown tired after lunch with 
producativity dropping. Maybe I should of switched. I am use to going to 
conferences and sticking to the same room all week. Maybe they could of 
given the streams topic names?

One of the streams was workshop based which I wasn't interested in. The third
stream looked like they had some interesting stuff. But at the end of the day
it doesn't matter. I enjoyed myself and looking forward to watching the talks
online that I missed. 

CYBER is hilirous. lulz when I heard the phase CYBER BULLY. Drinks a shot. 
CYBER was brought up again by the law dean as 
CYBER LAW. He was on a roll and rapped off a bunch of CYBER terms. Kiwicon
would of been proud. Finishes the bottle.

Digital Badge. When I saw the title of this talk I got excited, thinking they
were refering to LED based name tags but instead it was achievement points in 
a education course.

A Welsh fella - Glyndwr Jones or JONES did a talk on blended classes. He was 
quite the character and funny. The painting lacks much drawing - only a sad
cat due to parking charges at Waikato University.

This was an interesting talk as the speakers refered to SCRUM development being
used for course development. It's normally used in software so this was very 
interesting. Personally I'm not a big fan of agile/SCRUM development but great
to see it's crossing areas.

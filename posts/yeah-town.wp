<html><body><p>It's been a busy few days - I've been going into my Mothers work and doing painting with the kids - 4 year olds. When I made it home I got stuck into a digital paintings in GIMP. It's been a awhile since I did an environment work so decided to


Alright, here's the works:

I've drawn this image of the Yeah Yeahs before - in pencil. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/ca.yeah_.ine_.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1602" title="ca.yeah.;ine" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/ca.yeah_.ine_-1024x341.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="194"></a>Line. I am concerned with the scale and perspective of the Karon O figure - especially with the cars and pole in the back. The pole looks like it's coming out of her ankle.

The Gray. <em> </em>I started over the right side and worked left - with an effort to make interesting textures from the same brush. Maybe I should of used multiply brushes. I ignored the reference and focused on the line work - creating a tonal piece that doesn't feel like a paint over. I have been applying a paint over technique to my works that I have found to be giving a weird look - focusing less on the paint over and more on creating an interesting paint layer.

I lowed the opacity for the color to 20% and just painted over the gray. I used two blues for the sky, red for the tree leaves and ground, orange for other ground areas. The area on the left - which looks like mountains I used orange on it. I spread a green around the page - Karons clothes, areas in the background and on the ground on the left.

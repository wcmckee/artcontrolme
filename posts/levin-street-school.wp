<html><body><p>After uploading so much digital works lately I thought I'd better scan in sketchbook works. It's important to me that I can out of the house everyday with this sketchbook and get two drawings done. Not everyday this happens, but when it does I feel good. These works are all from various locations in Levin. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/12.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1267" title="1" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/12-1024x720.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="410"></a> Old letterbox in my Mothers backyard. It was a beautiful afternoon and I sat on the deck with my sketchbook, drank a beer, ate lemonades, and sketched. This is one of the more zoomed drawings I've done recently. The box was painted with spraypaint by me. The 'No Junk' is a Russian font I found on the internet and copied. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/31.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1269" title="3" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/31-1024x706.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="402"></a> View in the new library. I sat on the 2nd flour and drew the view looking outside. Lights were the main focus. Some vegetation/cars outside can be seen. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/21.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1268" title="2" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/21-1024x737.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="420"></a>2nd part of previous drawing. Not so much detail as the previous page. Lights hanging down are plentyful though. I focused on scaling the lights in order to show the prespective of the room. It was certainly refereshing to draw a different scene over the usual light pole and trees. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/41.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1270" title="4" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/41-1024x716.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="408"></a> View of the Levin mall that I've drawn several times before. Focus this time was less on the building and more on the trees and car. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/51.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1271" title="5" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/51-1024x709.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="404"></a> Front of the car, trees and vegetation in the background. Again, not alot of detail in this one. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/61.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1272" title="6" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/61-1024x703.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="400"></a>View of Oxford Street. I like how I've rendered the plants, It's created quite a mass of information  The top left is certainly missing information .. maybe I should of added clouds to this area. During this drawing I talked to a man called Rex. He has a video production company in Levin. I need to get in contact with him and visit his studio - should ring tomorrow.

Scale! Light pole scaling off into the distance. I talked to Rex for sometime so headed home shortly after. Strugled somewhat with the right side. I'm really happy with the left though. so I guess it makes up for it. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/81.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1274" title="8" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/81-1024x701.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="399"></a>View from a seat on Queen Street. I've drawn this scene many times before, but it's always a new experience. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/91.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1279" title="9" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/91-1024x746.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="425"></a>This was drawn at home, in the tunnel house. I don't normally draw at home but it was a sunny day and I was relaxing with a Double Brown, talking to Dad and some friends from down the road.



This drawing is of the wooden pillars in the tunnel house and a chain holding up a plant.

My sister came for a walk with me and I brought her lunch. Sadly I had forgot my clutch pencil - it was a disaster. I was going to go home without drawing - oh the horror. But I decided to pop into a shop and buy a pack of two HB pencils. These were ok but I still preferred my clutch. I found it once I got home, we were reunited.



Typical scene that I have been drawing recently, Subway is on the left. For the tree leaves I just made



<a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/111.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1276" title="11" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/111-1024x709.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="404"></a>The right side of the page. This was a disaster. I got the perspective wrong and added the car in - when really the car is much further to the right. I tried to fix this by attempting to change the car into clouds. The poles scaling down are correct. Holley was getting cold and wanted to head off so I gave up on this one. Happy with the left page though

<a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/121.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1277" title="12" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/121-1024x701.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="399"></a>I need to draw in a variety of locations. I get sucking into drawing the same scenes several times, which isn't a bad thing, but it is refeshing to draw something new, and keeps me on my toes.



This scene is a drawing of a local school - Levin North School. I attended this school in the late 90s. It hasn't changed and it was nice to sit on the field and draw the buildings. Many wonderful memories here - mostly role playing television and movies characters with friends (Batman and Stargate SG1)

It's working well. Looking forward to taking these drawings into GIMP and producing paintings.</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>It had been a week since I'd been into TLC. Today was Dans life drawing class. The model was Russel. The class wasn't partially full, a decent amount of people but still enough room to move about without bumping shoulders.


I used colored pencil for the majority of the day, with a small amount of 4b pencil in the afternoon.



Here's the work<a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/DSCF5592.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-347" title="DSCF5592" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/DSCF5592-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="438"></a>



These are the warmups. All are around 20 seconds. I'm rather happy with these. It wasn't my most successful life drawing day but I feel I started well and ended on a good note.



Fifteen minutes were spent working on these quick works - so able to get plenty of figures down. And If it's not the best pose - Don't have to wait long till it changes!

The left side of the page. Photo was taken close up in order to get a decent view of the art. Lots of line!

Series of three poses in the morning. These were 10 mins each I believe. The right is my favorite., it's got the most going for it. Others commented about it as well including Dan, Leah, and Rachel.

Turning the model into 'basic' shapes. A new way I'm looking at the model - this will make it easy to take the figure into blender.

Some tone used in the arm and such - line has been a focus in my work. <a style="font-style: normal; line-height: 24px; text-decoration: underline;" href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/DSCF5590.jpg">

I said to Dan that I'll like to paint on Friday. I havn't painted for a long time, I strugged drawing for 6 hours today and I'd like to relax with paint for the day on Friday.



I'll work on different angled figure poses in the Monday class and paint on Fridays.</p></body></html>

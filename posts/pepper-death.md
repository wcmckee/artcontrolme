Currently in Levin. I am over 50% through The Pillars of the Earth. It is long
but I am enjoying it.

I decided to add the four horsemen into the world of Pepper and Carrot. 

In Good Omens they are featured and I wanted to write a novel about the
characters. Mixing them into Pepper and Carrot is interested. Moulding
them into current events - such as them being involved with The Great Tree.

Characters.  This was drawn on the bus travelling from Hamilton 
to Levin. 1120 was the bus number, written on the piece of 
artwork.

The Great Tree. It's black trunk leading up to it's branches. 
It's leaves swish in the heavy winds. Underneath are the 
residents buildings. 

Mixing in ideas from reading The Pillars of The Earth.

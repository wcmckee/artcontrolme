Currently I am in Hamilton. I am reading Lie Down With Lions. 
Here is the artwork that I have created recently on with my portable pi
workstation - I drew the majority of these when I went to Hamilton Writers Den, Hamilton Computer
Club and Hamilton Life Drawing.

Drawn with inspiration from [Art100](http://wikieducator.org/Art_Appreciation_and_Techniques).
Not Allot of drawing images in this - mostly just drawing words from the 
wiki page.

Another piece from art100. This looks at empathy and literary fiction.

I finished Fall of Giants when I was in Levin and loved it. In the center
of this image it reads: write prose based on recent book - Fall Of Giants.

Hamilton Computer Club pamphlet inspired work. I picked the pamphlet up 
during the day and reworked it. I would like to create a a5 pamphlet for 
Hamilton Computer Club to advertise the club - similar idea to what I did
several months ago with Hamilton Python User Group.

On Friday I went to life drawing. I arrived late and missed out on the 
quick warm up poses. This drawing was a 20 minute standing pose. The 
model had her back to me so it was hard to capture much detail. I almost
managed to capture the full model - cut from the knees down. 

One of the best things about the location is the view of the river and 
nature outside. I sat so I could lookout to the view, with the nude model 
between. Capturing the benches and leaves of the trees. To the left and
right of her head is the wall panel - complete with power sockets.

This was the final life drawing for the day. The pose was a long 30minutes
lying pose. I found it hard to capture - even after walking around the 
room for a better view.

This was a strange 10 minute pose. The models ankles were sore so she 
had one leg. Pose was 10minutes. It was interesting but hard for the 
model to keep still.

![lifedraw-portrait](/galleries/2016/05/14/lifedraw-portrait.png)

My favorite life drawing of the day. This was a sitting pose. The model 
is drawn twice - the first larger focusing on her portrait. The 2nd drawing
of the model is in the top right hand corner. It's more of stick figure
drawing but it captures the full shape of the model. I ran out of room 
to draw the arm so it's on the left side of the page. At the bottom 
the Waikato river runs through the page. 

![romanticlit](/galleries/2016/05/14/romanticlit.png)

The cycle of Romantic Literature. A piece from art100. This piece focuses
on drawing elements from Fall Of Giants - world war 1. Man with a gas mask,
and guns.

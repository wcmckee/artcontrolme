<html><body><p>Six hours of life drawing with Robert. Normally it would be three hours on Monday/Tuesday/Wednesday but this term it's switched around. Fine with me as I get the chance to jump into Christenas class for the rest of the week. So much life models - but great to end the term with a bang


I spent the day carrying on with oil pastels - seemed fitting to keep the development and exploration happening. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/DSCF5530-Custom.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-214" title="DSCF5530 (Custom)" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/DSCF5530-Custom.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600"></a>



Graphite 8b warmups. Some tone is applied to areas. Alot of this is done blind which I feel I've been neglecting. Good practice. I like the strong straight line work on some of these. These were just warmups and I switched to oil pastel for the rest of the day.

Those feet on the top left are looking better! It's certainly something I have to focus more on - feet and hands.

You can see the pencil lines. More curvy lines are used in areas - and they work. I'm always worried that the curvy lines wont look at good as my normal straight lines. But I wont know unless I do them!

This was the only time I used white crayon - I used it more yesterday. Rachel said she liked this one, but I don't think much of it.



I talked about the chair with Angelique - I found it helpful using the chair for reference in measuring the anatomy. The proportions are certainly blown up here.



Another couple of pieces that I'm not happy with. Something it just doesn't work.

Here I've progressed from yesterday and decided to use a black. This was a hard choice as it destroyed the color somewhat - I got around this by using a cloth and smudging the black into the work. This gave it a more painterly effect and wasn't so over whelming,



<a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/DSCF5523-Custom.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-216" title="DSCF5523 (Custom)" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/DSCF5523-Custom.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600"></a>When black is added to yellow green is often created. This happens here. I'm not too sure about this color. It's getting quite muddy.



<a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/DSCF5531-Custom.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-210" title="DSCF5531 (Custom)" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/DSCF5531-Custom.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600"></a>This was the long pose. It was spose to go all afternoon (3 hours) but people didn't want a pose that long. Instead this went for 1.5 hours. I'm happy that I got a long pose in that really allowed me to develop the drawing.



I started it how I started the rest - with a pencil outline of the figure and features. Then went in with red for the darks. Yellow for the lights. I covered reds with yellow as well. This helped give it depth. I then added a white - especially on the yellow areas - which hadn't had any layers yet. This gave a interesting texture and of course depth to the piece. Finally finished it off with black - used a hand towel and rubbed into areas. This really brought areas forward. This is the suggestions that Roger would of given me. I wish I had him there today to help!



Tomorrow I may work in my visual diary - I'll switch to pencil and colored pencil if so. Or I'll keep working on an easel with brown paper and pastels. See what happens at the time!

My laptop is currently out of action. I do however have my phones which ive been getting back into since the laptop charger breaking.

This is a digital painting produced in sketchbook pro on the device. The original art was a water color painting - created by my friend Cathern. 

This is some concept art for the game Cafrin 2: episode one.

The first game was created with python for the gameboy jam.</body></html>

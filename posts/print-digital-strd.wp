<html><body><p>Digital works that I worked on last night. I have the flu so havn't been drawing (or even leaving the house). I'll keep warm and recovery should be fine.


Here are some JPGs and GIFs....

Several lithograph prints were created from it. I decided to open it in GIMP and produce a paint over. Though it's the same process as the sketchbook to digital works I've decided to use a different yellow - to explore greens.

Sketchbook development here. Interesting mix of trees and buildings. No blue. Maybe it should be added.

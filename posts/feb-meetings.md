I have a new touch screen for my Raspberry Pi. It's still the same size - 
480px by 320px but it is no longer cracked. The touch works! I still have 
my old touch screen and would like to find a use for it. Attaching it to 
somewhere that is useful - streaming cat gifs. 

Here are some recent artworks created with GIMP:

![drawn-pulpfic-bw](/galleries/2016/02/19/gdrawn-pulpfic-bw.png)

It doesn't happen often but here is a grayscale tonal painting of 
PulpFictionDiction from getsdrawn. I like painting the text. I have 
croped this as the rest of the painting was blank.  
 
![drawn-pulpfic](/galleries/2016/02/19/gdrawn-pulpfic.png)

On the top left is the line layer of the previous painting. The rest of the 
image is sketches of robots and landscapes. Typical.

This is sizeways as I had the Raspberry Pi hanging from my bed well I drew.
Some of the image is up the correct way - the landscape in the bottom left
looks correct. The text is not.

![hamcompclub](/galleries/2016/02/19/hamcompclub.png)

This was drawn at the Hamilton Computer Club. It was the Feb 2016 Thursday
meeting.  Sadly the meeting was spent sorting 'rules'. I guess it needed to
be sorted but I'm looking forward to speakers later on in the year. 

![hpug-ldo](/galleries/2016/02/19/hpug-ldo.png)

This was drawn during the Hamilton Python User Group. Again this was the 
Feb 2016 meeting. Lorance did a talk on IPython/Jupyter Notebook. There 
was also much discussion regarding next months meeting. Next month I will
do a talk on Nikola.

I have been watching Linux Conf Aus videos on my laptop and painting them
as I watch them. It is certainly not the experience of being there, but 
the talk talks are informative. 

![monster-cake](/galleries/2016/02/19/monster-cake.png)

No text, just drawing. Monsters, robots, and landscapes.

![alace-begi](/galleries/2016/02/19/palace-begin.png)

I use to be a big fan of the website conceptart.org especially
during my time at The Learning Connextion. It had been awhile 
since I had visited the site so I took a look. Enviortments on 
the week was always my favourite. The theme was Palace of Time. 
I need to visit the site regularly as it is great inspirion for 
drawing. 

![sleepslee](/galleries/2016/02/19/sleepsleep.png)

several portraits draw from getsdrawn. isnipor and tklfota. 

![wacom-artist](/galleries/2016/02/19/wacom-artist.png)

Illustation of my setup and a self portrait.

![wdh-feb](/galleries/2016/02/19/wdh-feb.png)

writers den notes during the meeting. I got there late but got
quite a bit of drawing completed. 

![wdh-romance](/galleries/2016/02/19/wdh-romance.png)

The theme for the next Writers Den Hamilton is romance. It was 
my idea. I am not going to be at the next meeting but I've 
been thinking about the theme and have ideas. 

This was drawn at the Sunday Den meeting, it was mostly sketching 
ideas for the romance theme. 

![write-ladder](/galleries/2016/02/19/write-ladder.png)

Short story I started during the Wednesday Den meeting. The words 
on the left of the page are prompts given by each member. We were 
given ten minutes to come up with a story with the words. A points 
system was used but it didn't really work. Who's counting?

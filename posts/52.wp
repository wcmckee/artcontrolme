<html><body><p>Here’s a The Lion King and The Dark Knight Rises mash up. I saw this on <a href="http://mashable.com/2012/01/02/dark-knight-rises-lion-king-parody-trailer/" target="_blank">Mashable </a>and love it.


The Lion King was the first film I saw at the Cinema Beethoven was spose to be the first but I saw the poster for Alien 3 and refused to enter – Mum had to return the tickets and we went to the video store where I hired out movies I had seen many times before. Mum was disappointed.



Skipping a few years, my  sister Holley would watch The Lion King multi times a day on VHS. She loved it. It drove me insane. To this day I haven’t re-watched it since Holleys bursts. I have it on my laptop so may have to harden up and watch it. Excellent film.

<html><body><p>Good morning. The art creation has been slow as of recently. I even tried to draw last night. I sat on a table and had my sketchbook and clutch pencil. I just couldn't do it. I was unable to draw. It frustrates me.


So I have very little new art to upload, so here are some works from GIMP that I did several weeks ago - they have just been sitting in my drafts - may as well get them posted.

Focus on scale with the shoulder - the perspective seems to be working - large arm (almost too large!). I like this piece, something about it - that cartoonist feeling happening.

I used a dark gray for the darks and a mid gray for lights, didn't bother with tone on the shirt (just left it white) - negative space creates the shirt. In the background I went with a very light gray. One area that is frustrating is the nose - I've gone in with a black and it stands out like a sore thumb. This should be dark gray. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/RDRAW.mattshan.col_.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1627" title="RDRAW.mattshan.col" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/RDRAW.mattshan.col_-819x1024.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="730"></a>Color added. I kept with color I was use to - dropping their opacity to 20% and using them as a wash over the gray. Yellow for the skin and blue for the background. Maybe I should of gone in with a red in areas?<iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/nNQhQUcADJs" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315"></iframe>



And the video. Enjoy.<a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/rdraw.couple2.tone_.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1622" title="rdraw.couple2.tone" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/rdraw.couple2.tone_-937x1024.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="638"></a>



Another portrait. This time was a double. I like drawing multi figures in a piece - makes it easier for measuring! Sorry there is no line for this. Make a mistake and painted the gray over the line - losing the line. There is evidence of the line in there! It must have been a bad day when I did this as I have no color version of the work. Oh well, here's the video:<iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/ukxIf5WtCMU" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315"></iframe>



Video. Have a great day.</p></body></html>

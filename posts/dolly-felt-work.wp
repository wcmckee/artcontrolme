Her Feet People. It was a rainy day. Her shoes and socks were wet. She took them off. 

She has excellent ideas regarding art activities and came up with the idea of tracing her feet.

This tracing of her feet was developed further into characters.

The character on the left is Dolly and on the right is meÂ  - William. The characters are holding hands :)

The clothing and colors are the same as what we were wearing. Awesome obsovational traits.

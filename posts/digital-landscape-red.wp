<html><body><p>After starting several landscape paintings with acrylic paint on board I had a go with digital ideas. I worked on these Thursday night on my travel from Wellington to Levin. I spoke to no one on the train, spenting the time on the computer and resting.

Similar start to the acrylic paintings. I like going in dark to define areas then using the gray for the environment. Colours are built up similar to how I would do it with acrylic. More detail is needed to bring it to a finished level.

I need to reopen this file and add more infomation and detail. Trees could work.



Life drawing tomorrow.</p></body></html>

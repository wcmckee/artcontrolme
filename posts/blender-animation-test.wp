<html><body><p>I did a scribble in Andrews a6 visual diary. It was the first time I'd used a pencil all holidays. I've mostly been spending my time with Blender - creating animations. I imported some of my artwork into the program and traced around it. I'd like to explore the idea of a 2d world further with the help of my artwork and blender.

Can you spot my artwork in amongst the mess?</p></body></html>

so i have registered for wikieducator. It offers free elearning resources. I am enjoying editing and adding content. Areas that I was interested in  
adding resources were tech, digital citizenship, art. 
[Conferences and Events](http://wikieducator.org/Conference_and_Events). I came across a course from Otago Polytechnic on Tourism and Travel.
I felt I could contribute to the resources on conferences. It's always safe to add links. I included a few links - to AV recording talk and to 
lanyrd - the site that lists conferences and events. I added some education resources on AV setups at conferences and expanded the section on goodie
bags. 

Here is the artwork that I have created

The beginning. In the right side Conference and Events is written in caps,
with learning objectives under. Around the screen are scatted portraits 
and figures. A skull with drum sticks poking through. Characters with 
flower heads.

Continue with the flower head - now the figure has several. Border around
the edge of lines and dots.

The goodie bag was one area I was able to expand on the education resources. 
This is a brainstorm of ideas behind a goodie bag.

Exploring ideas for conferences with the idea of tourist focused conference 
division. For those that do not want to attend the main conference, workshops,
and seminars. Often ran as a family even. One parent attending conference,
other and kids on tourist activities. 
Don't want family stuck in hotel room when attending conference.

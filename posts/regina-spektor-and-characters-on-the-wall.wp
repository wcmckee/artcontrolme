The reference was placed on the left side and I worked in the line on the right.

I decided to show her the tool and this is the result. We compared the smudged to the non-smudged. She liked the smudged version better. Personally I like the non smudge. Being about to see the brush strokes and use them as part of creating the form. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/regina-color.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2778" alt="regina-color" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/regina-color.png" width="1200" height="1200"></a>



Color. Showed how I use a limited amount of colors but a range of tones of each color. New color for the shirt. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/regina-color.png">

Reference for this were photos on the shelf. I drew the characters, the frame around them, and the mantel piece they sit on. Turned it into a landscape work with the clouds in the back and scaling of the photos. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/wainuippl-color.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2783" alt="wainuippl-bw" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/wainuippl-bw.jpg" width="2000" height="667"></a>



Black and white. Focused very little but instead just gave the impression. In the background I defined the land. The characters are lighter than usual. Black frame septrates them from the landscape scene. On the left is square tiles. I like these for the ground. Above this a character is erupting from the land. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/wainuippl-color.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2780" alt="wainuippl-color" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/wainuippl-color.jpg" width="2000" height="667"></a>



 



Color. I said in a recent post I wanted to use more browns in my work. Here I've done this with the land. Experimenting with the saturation levels of the brown - interesting grays appearing on the right hand center. For the water I used the green - exploring a range of brushes. I like the center area green - it has a flow to it that works. Building up those tones is helping.



That's all for today.</p></body></html>

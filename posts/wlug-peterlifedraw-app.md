Life drawing. Peter a regular from the group was the model. It's the first time since I started attending life drawing in Hamilton that we had a male model - it was a nice change. 

I liked the pose and drawing on the right. The circle bald spot on his head is shown - surrounded by spiky straight hair. His arms rested on his knees. These were 5 minute poses.

Sitting pose. This was a 10 minute pose that was drawn before the break. Instead of sitting looking out the window I decided to sit on the other side of the room - looking out towards the kitchen and toilets. The ladies bathroom door is visible.

After the break a long 40 minute pose. I used dots on the figures leg in order to show the spotty completion of that area of the body. On the bottom is a portrait of a fellow artist. The USB cable for my power pack and unstable so I don't like walking around the room with the Pi, forcing me to stay in the same spot. Need a new USB cable!

I like the portrait on the left. It has a nice style and it's captured the likeness of the model.

The warm up poses for the day. A series of 2 minute poses. Peter was excellent with the use of props - a wooden stick and chairs.

Notes taken during WLUG June meeting. The topic was systemd. It was interesting and I learnt some new commands.

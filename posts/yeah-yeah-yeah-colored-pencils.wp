<html><body><p>Back in Wellington. Nice to be back I guess. I've been enjoying colored pencil, yesterday I didn't work with Blender - instead sketched in my visual diary. I've got a strong mindset to take these ideas into Blender. Something is brewing.


Back in 2010 I got really into the Yeah Yeah Yeahs and I frequently drew the band.

This was one of the reference photos I completed a drawing of. In order to compare my drawing and check development I redrew this photo. Here's what I came up with:

Strong straight lines, color used for tone. I love this color scene - red, yellow, brown for the characters and blues for negative space. Several sketches of wire frames to help understand walk cycles further.

Less character based and more animation feel. I'm not sure what I'm doing with this but I'm going to take these into blender today and experiment.</p></body></html>

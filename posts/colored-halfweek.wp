<html><body><p>I have been busy this week with pencil and colored pencil. Often its just drawing from imagination but a focus on landscapes and characters. Molding them together.


On Friday I cutup brown paper into long stripes to use. Just like at art school!

Pencil on paper. One request was the sunflower (see right of 'William'). I love requests! Several characters are also created, then a landscape. Notes on the right regarding color.

Color pencil. I could not find a green pencil. I wanted to cover the landscape and maybe areas of ground with it. Instead I used browns, reds and blues. Purple lightning!

Oil pastel. This is a train track. Blue water is flooding the track. Character portrait on the left. Red house in the distance. It's raining blue.

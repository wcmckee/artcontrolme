<html><body><p>Long walk today to St Lukes but afterwards I opened up GIMP and imported pencil works to work on.


I choose to work on two works - the first, a figure drawing I did during my time in Wellington last. Seems like such a long time ago now.



<a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/figure-line.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2090" alt="figure-line" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/figure-line-768x1024.jpg" width="625" height="833"></a>



The line was created on the same layer as the drawing sadly. Normally I'm good at creating a new layer first - but this time I messed up. It's alright. I normally don't use the line for much but rather develop the painted layer further. I decided to draw the light and dark separates  inside the figure rather than just tracing around. This makes it easier for the next stage.... <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/figure-line.jpg">

My favorite area is the top half, but I guess the bottom is interesting as well, how it fades into the background. Maybe some more dark in the bottom/right could help the contrast?



ok, onto the second painting I did today - <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/napier-line.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2092" alt="napier-line" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/napier-line-1024x724.jpg" width="625" height="441"></a>The reference for this was a drawing I did during my time in Napier visiting my Grandfather. It was one of my more successful drawings during the time. As you can see I didn't make the same mistake as the previous work and it's on a new layer. The detail is somewhat lower than some of the previous environmental works I have done. I had considered adding the right page drawing onto it - at one point I began scaling this image down in order to make room. I decided against it in the end, though I could mix other line drawings into this in the future and repaint.



<a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/napier-tone.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2093" alt="napier-tone" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/napier-tone-1024x724.jpg" width="625" height="441"></a>Gray-scale tone added. I used two brushes for this - the first a standard flat brush that offered no texture and the second a charcoal. I guess it's good I'm trying new brushes, but maybe I should be making my own. I used the smooth brush on the Church and charcoal brush on the trees to give a contrast in the objects. For a long time I just kept with a single brush but looking at this I know it's very important to create a range of textures using several different brushes.



You may notice there is no figure or other object to help show the scale. I added in some figure that I had recently painted.



<a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/napier-tonep.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2094" alt="napier-tonep" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/napier-tonep-1024x724.jpg" width="625" height="441"></a>Ok. I played around with this for awhile, experimenting with scale and location of the figure. In this mock up I added Annabels figure to the left and scaled it large - in other versions I had scaled her right down and added her higher (where her face is currently). This didn't look right and it worked bigger as a larger figure. I also tried adding the nude to this side of the page also but wasn't happy - mostly because of the strange angle of the arms (still not happy about those arms). Added the nude to the right seems to work better.



I am going to the Auckland library today, I'll look for concept art books for some inspiration.</p></body></html>

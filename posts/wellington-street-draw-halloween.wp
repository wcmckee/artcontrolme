<html><body><p>I recently got back from a weeks holiday in Wellington. During that time I spent hours on the street of Wellington sketching. For months I have been doing these daily 'sketchcrawls' around Levin. It was great to draw Wellington.


Here's the works:

Tuesday evening. This was shortly after getting off the TLC bus. I needed to wait around town for two hours as life drawing was happening at Vincents at 7pm. I had just brought a new clutch pencil from the TLC store - had store credit which I needed to spend. It was weird getting use to the new clutch pencil - and took me some time to warm up.



This drawing is of the waterfront. The building behind the camera is the Rowing Club. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSCF0296.jpg">

Another waterfront work. This one is of the playground area. I drew this on Sunday morning. The angles of the playground were a challenge  I didn't spent long on this - Wellington was cold so I had to keep moving



<a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSCF0304.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1407" title="DSCF0304" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSCF0304-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="438"></a>Typical Cuba Street view. This was drawn on the 31st of October - Halloween. I didn't do anything for Halloween but people came out to town for it. Town was busy. This image needs more dark.

<a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSCF02931.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1398" title="DSCF0293" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSCF02931-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="438"></a>Waterfront. Somewhat happy with this. The composition is stronger than previous - and my line/tone is confident. I've been trying to create a range of textures using mark making techniques - such as small horizontal straight lines to represent water, curvy lines to show the plant material (but also straight lines in a leaf shape,  the hills were created using directional lines to build up the 3d shape.



Second page. This is the outside of a bar. People are standing outside looking out into the water. Beautiful day. The bridge continues in the foreground. Somewhat empty than the first page.



<a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSCF0298.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1401" title="DSCF0298" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSCF0298-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="438"></a>



Cuba Street. Sitting on a bench looking toward the shops on the right. Capturing all the information that I can see. Managed to capture some figures. I don't spent long on the figures but just use them to give a sense of scale to the work.



<a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSCF0299.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1402" title="DSCF0299" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSCF0299-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="438"></a>



Second page. This is one of the most complete drawings I've done. I partially enjoyed drawing the animal outside the bookstore. It gave the scene - 'oh yeah, I know where that is'. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSCF0299.jpg">

</a><a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSCF0300.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1403" title="DSCF0300" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSCF0300-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="438"></a>Courtney Place. I started drawing this scene but got ineruped with two Germans talking to me. We talked for sometime - I showed them my sketchbook and then they took off. It was getting cold (cold seems like a theme in Wellington) so took off home. I continued the drawing at the same spot on Sunday. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSCF0301.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1404" title="DSCF0301" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSCF0301-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="438"></a>Second page. The Telstra Clear logo finishes - pole in the foreground blocks the view, and a car takes up most of the space. Capturing a range of planes helps the scale of the work.



View on Willis Street. I had just been to Gordon Harris. I stopped on a bench nearby to draw and rest. The view was a typical cafe view outside. I like the lights. The detail in these are improving - the tone helps. Captured several figures. People generally stayed still as they were waiting for the bus. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1409" title="DSCF0306" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSCF0306-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="438"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1410" title="DSCF0307" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSCF0307-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="438">A billboard took up the majority of the page. It was advertising something about dumping rubbish and the circle that happens. I drew in areas of the poster into my work. I'm not sure about using brands in my drawings. Often I just create rectangles for writing areas. But then again - it will be more correct to add these elements in. I guess whatever feels right.

The dark tonal areas (on the left) feels very close.

Railway station. This was the final drawing I did in Wellington. It's my favorite - nice to leave on a high. I drew this same scene when I was leaving Wellington two months ago. Great to go back and compare they two. My level of detail has certainly increased. I feel more confident in using tone in these streetworks. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSCF03131.jpg">

</a><a style="font-style: normal; line-height: 24px; text-decoration: underline;" href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSCF03141.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1417" style="border-color: #bbbbbb; background-color: #eeeeee;" title="DSCF0314" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSCF03141-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="438"></a>



Tone wasn't used hugely in this railway drawing, mostly in the figures/beams/and started on the windows. I spent sometime drawing the Gundi statue. He stayed still for me. <a style="font-style: normal; line-height: 24px; text-decoration: underline;" href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSCF03141.jpg">

</a><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1411" title="DSCF0308" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSCF0308-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="438">One of my final waterfront drawings. Very happy with this one. The boats were especially fun to draw into the scene - so often I draw the same objects it's great to have something completely different. I struggled with the perspective in the distance - often I look, then make a line, then look again and see I did the opposite  I need to focus on capturing the right direction. As always, Ball in the foreground helps give the scene a sense of diminision.

<a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSCF0309.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1412" title="DSCF0309" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSCF0309-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="438"></a>And the second page. Several boats parked next to one another. They were helpful for measuring the scene, and filling up the water. It's better to have a chaotic scene than empty. Quick outline of a figure in the foreground.

Just went to New World for lunch. Found a seat nearby to draw. Spent the majority of the time working on the lights and shelter behind. There was a large building the the background. Tone added to areas - the signs and the sky.



<a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSCF0303.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1406" title="DSCF0303" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSCF0303-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="438"></a>



Second page. Clouds in the sky. Poles scaling up to show the distance. Some vegetation scatted in areas. New World building on the right. Cars on the bottom left - very rough.

<html><body><p>I spend the majority of my digital painting time in GIMP. I love it, I always will. I've tried other Raster programs out there - and will continue to use - DeviantArt Muro, Manga Studio, MyPaint, Alchemy, Photoshop.


There is another set of programs I can paint with.. Vector. During Highschool I spent time learning Freehand. It was a favorite program. I enjoyed this more than Photoshop. Having a tablet back then would of been great - even if it was a tiny 2x2 screen size.



Anyway, I learnt Freehand, then moved onto Illustrater. In 2007 I did the majority of my digital work in Illustrater. Later I moved to Inkscape - cos it's not Adobe.



Here are two logo/header displays and a paint over of a sketch:<a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/path4719PosPostPostt.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913" title="path4719PosPostPostt" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/path4719PosPostPostt.png" alt="" width="3864" height="1802"></a>This is a paint over as well. I used a figure from GIMP and painted over in Inkscape. I used my mouse for it. I've been using the tablet lots - it needs a new nib and I can't find the packet. I think the mouse does a decent job at painting. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/path4719PostPost.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914" title="path4719PostPost" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/path4719PostPost.png" alt="" width="4281" height="2746"></a>Clearly the model is James. Who else could look like this? One of the advantages of having these files as Vector objects is the freedom. I can scale, and mix without losing any detail. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/path801.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-920" title="path80" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/path801.png" alt="" width="800" height="709"></a>Paint over of Lynn Mall sketch. Color used is inspired by my other works. I think I'll keep working in Inkscape. It's something different that allows me to create works digitally.</p></body></html>

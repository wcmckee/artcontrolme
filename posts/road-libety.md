Seven recent artworks. Sadly I lost the wireless dongle for my wacom tablet so I have had to go back to using a normal USB cable. I only owned the dongle for a week before it fell out of the drawing tablet when I was walking home. When I buy a new one in the future I will tape the battery in so that it doesn't fall out. I have lost the cover for the wacom to keep the battery safe. 
It was upsetting for the first couple of days that I lost it - basically the same as throwing 70 dollars down the drain. Anyway I think I'm over it now and just been drawing in my room mostly.

Created at Hamilton Python Users Group. For this meeting we didn't have a speaker, instead we watched two videos from the recent pycon. I had seen both the videos but it was enjoyable to re-watch and see peoples reactions. The artwork includes notes from the when is it good to be bad talk.

Drawn during all you can eat hells pizza. Landscapes, towers, a magical forest.

I'm doing a course on statistics. Started taking notes on it but got distracted and did Pepper and Carrot sketches instead.

Thursday night I attended Hamilton Book Club. These are the notes that I took during the meeting. I hadn't finished the book myself. People really seemed to enjoy it. It annoyed me that the characters did not have names.

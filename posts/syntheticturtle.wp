Portrait I painted of Reddit user - syntheticturtle.



This was from redditgetsdrawn.



I've started working on another game - this time for the Peace, Love and Jam. It starts next weekend but I'm going to just work on it during the weekend since I don't have time during the week.



I've been setting up an easel at Fairfield Community Centre to get the after-school kids to do some art. It's great - got a minute of six year olds, up to twelve. I'll make another post in the future with some of these images (been taking photos on my phone).



Enjoy this digital painting, three layer, line, gray, and color.

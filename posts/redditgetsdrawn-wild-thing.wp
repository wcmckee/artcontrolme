<html><body><p>As a child where the Wild Things Was a favorite book. For this request on RedditGetsDrawn I was asked too draw<a href="http://i.imgur.com/bW2Mh.jpg"> this childÂ </a>with Wild Things. I did a quick google search for reference and found<a href="http://nmbdesigner.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/things-are_page_201.jpg"> this reference</a> that I choose to use.<a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/rdraw-wildthing-line.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1589" title="rdraw-wildthing-line" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/rdraw-wildthing-line-1024x618.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="352">L</a>ine. I had fun using the book illustration as reference - a different look to my usual street scene ones.<a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/rdraw-wildthing-bw.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1587" title="rdraw-wildthing-bw" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/rdraw-wildthing-bw-1024x618.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="352"></a>Grayscale. Huge contrast between the figure and background. Looking at this now I think that it could of done with more lights in the trees/sky. In the following stage - color, I fixed this by using a light blue.<a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/rdraw-wildthing-col.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1588" title="rdraw-wildthing-col" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/rdraw-wildthing-col-1024x618.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="352"></a>Color. I used several large brushes in this which has given it a misty look.</p></body></html>

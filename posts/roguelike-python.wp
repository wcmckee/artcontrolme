<html><body><p>So this week has flown by. I didn't get half the stuff I wanted to get done. I'm happy with my blender work. and the small level I made in the Hammer editor - lighting has been a big theme for the week.


Today I decided to get back into using python. I needed a project to work on. Something that could work with the blender works or my artwork in general. Roguelike.



So using Python and <a href="http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php/Complete_Roguelike_Tutorial,_using_python%2Blibtcod">this guide</a> I've been working on creating a Roguelike.



Here's a screenshot so far.

I felt I've learnt alot about game mechanics with this tutorial. I'll keep working on it tonight and see where I go. Life drawing tomorrow and Sunday. Have the make the Sunday market as well!



It would be awesome to create a 3d Roguelike with my own artwork and design.</p></body></html>

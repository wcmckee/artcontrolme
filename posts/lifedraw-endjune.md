Artwork from the past few days. I attended life drawing on Friday which was 
excellent and on Saturday - Hamilton Book Club. I also read The Wrath of Grapes.

The Wrath of Grapes and 12 Monkeys. I watched season two of 12 monkeys and drew
this as I was watching it.

Warm up poses. I hadn't drawn the model before The model was older but had a 
slim figure with short curly hair.

The final poses for the day. I did draw the final pose but when I checked my
charge level I bumped the cable the computer reset. My final drawing was lost 
but whatever - it was only 15 minutes of drawing.

Sitting poses. Some  I get poses which are back poses which gives me little to
draw. Not here though. I guess it's one of the disadvantages of sitting on the side of the room 
by myself.

Using old life drawing and blog posts as reference and redrawing elements of it.

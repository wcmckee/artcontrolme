Colour. Blue and purle tinge. Quick loose work.

Sketching in the hallway and rego/food area before the start of global
game jam.

Colour layer created for game. Used the 3d model as reference when 
painting the logo. Team members are happy with title.

![rihana-bw](/galleries/2016/01/31/rihana-bw.png)

Cellistwitch and Rihana grayscale portraits. I like Cellistwitch but 
Rihanas could use more work. Can you still tell it's her?

Line layer. Rihanas face is complete. I have yet to hear her new 
album.

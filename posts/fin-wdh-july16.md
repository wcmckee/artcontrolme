In the past week I have completed 4 paintings. There is spose to be a 5th here 
but I forgot to export it and can't be bothered to sort it now. I will include
it in the next post.

The following art was created at Life Drawing Hamilton on Friday and Hamilton
Computer Club on Thursday/Saturday. My life consists of meet ups.

This was started during Thursday night meeting of Hamilton Computer Club. Linda
did a talk on editing photos with Google software. She also showed how to create
ecards with the website 123greetings.com. I think I would rather do something 
original for an ecard. When I use to have Facebook I would draw/paint portraits
of my friends for their birthday and post it to their wall. 

The figure drawings are the next day - life drawing Hamilton. I had drawn the 
model once before. These are the warm up - 2 minute poses.

Longer 5 min poses. I found it hard to concentrate and went to the toilet and 
even walked outside and made a phone call. Sometimes I feel I attend just so 
that there is enough people. Of course this isn't true and it's best I just 
attend each week and have a positive attitude.

The final three poses for the day. These were longer 15/20 minute poses. I did
move for the third one.

Started with a drawing of Maddie from a SIA video. When I got home from life 
drawing a bunch of Creative Commons pamphlets had arrived. This caused me to 
be inspired to work on ccanz stuff - including drawing of the pamphlets. In 
order for the page to not be too blank I filled the empty areas with a landscape. 

On Thursday night I am attending The Cure concert and planning on bringing the 
Pi along and drawings. I won't walk in with it but will set it up once I have 
my seat. Hopefully I get through security with it.

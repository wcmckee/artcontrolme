<html><body><p>Ok. So I went Vincents life drawing. It had beenÂ awhile. Successful night, This post isn't about life drawing though, blender update.


I've been a bit less motivated these past days to produce much. Tired and feeling generally down doesn't help. The life drawing at Vincents was a boost. I plan to transfer this energy to Mondays class next week.

I made a car thing in Maya. It isnt much but better then what I did with my time at UCOL. There are also several angles of a walk cycle.<iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/NtwR28nhJ_s" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315"></iframe>



I'd like to do more cell animation. A weekly walk cycle could be a good challenge. Planning and ideas is needed for future Blender projects.</p></body></html>

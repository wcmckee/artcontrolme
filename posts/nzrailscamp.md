Attended Rails Camp NZ 2016. It was my first Ruby event. The location was 
Wellington, New Zealand. Hired out YMCA  campgrounds on the weekend.

On the Saturday morning I went for a walk and drew horses.

Talks were given in a unconference style. There was no official timetable
but had a paper at the event with times  where people could  give  talks.
This was very similar to the DevMob even I went to last year.

The food and drinks were excellent. Nice to be in the shade,
reading The Pillars of the Earth and drinking apple cider. Currently 70%
through the book. Events progress the story.

Drawing the environment was fun. I focused mostly on trees as I had them
on my mind due to The Great Tree in Pepper&Carrot.

The weekend was perfect and I would attend future camps or conferences in the
future. There were five from Hamilton at the camp so worth looking at a 
ruby hamilton meetup.

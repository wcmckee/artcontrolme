<html><body><p>I can't sleep so got up and uploaded several digital drawings I did yesterday. 
It was an excellent day - Morning started with good news for a friend. 

I got into the community centre early - 1:30pm. I spent the next hour digital drawing people on RedditGetsDrawn. Sadly we had our /home directory die tonight before I had uploaded the images. He may be able to recover them - terrible day for the centre computers.

Anyway, once I got home tonight I produced several drawings, went to bed (couldn't sleep). Got up and created several more. 

Here are some results:

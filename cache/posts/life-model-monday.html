<p><html><body><p>I can’t believe it’s Friday. A whole week has flown by. I haven’t felt I’ve updated or worked on digital works</p>
<p>These are the life drawings for Dans class on Monday. The model was Loraine. I used graphite/colored pencil on brown paper. No paint.</p>
<p>I love drawing. Enjoy</p>

<p>Attempts at using curvy marks with the graphite. This is the hunky 8b. It’s shrinking. I got it during my time in foundation. Favorite of mine. Especially for warmups. It handles tone and light in longer poses.</p>

<p>This was a longer pose. To draw for 1.5 hours of the same figure pose one must learn techniques of slowing down. I believe this is an important step as an artist – especially for me. I love long poses. I didn’t always love them. Techniques need to develop.</p>

<p>Longer poses. One of the best things about a long pose is getting the work to a finished stage. I’m use to having drawings that look part finished.</p>

<p>White charcoal for the light highlights. Using two colors makes it simple to mark the light and the dark areas. That’s really all  looking for with a figure. A white pencil is worth investing in. This would mix well with the colored pencil. With Oil paint I would add white to colors to gain a muted effect (also increases opacity).</p>
<p>A goal for life drawing has been to capture more of the figure. I want to draw the figure highly representational. From there I can go anywhere.</p>

<p>A classic style I have developed. This is with layering colored pencil and graphite, using straight line, tone shaded with lights and darks. This is what I started in Rogers life drawing class. It’s a chance to take this idea further – especially with long poses.</p>

<p>Here’s taking it right back to basics. Looking at the poses with shapes. I don’t like this style generally but have found it useful for proportions and perspective. I’d like to take ideas from this and merge with a more tonal, organic looking being. Dan mentioned that it looked like the figure was dreaming… and I could add thought bubbles.</p>

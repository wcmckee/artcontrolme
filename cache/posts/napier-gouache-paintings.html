<p>Here are paintings I did from life during my time in Napier.</p>

<p>Everyday I went for a walk when I was in Napier. Majority of these walks were into town - to the waterfront. It was very hot during the day so the evening was the best time for me to be outside - it didn't get dark till late. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/draw-hello1.jpg"></p>

<p>I painted the same landscape multiply times - the view was South. This was one of my first ones - where I'm still warming up <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/draw-hello1.jpg"></p>
<p></a><a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/nap-watercolor-deco2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1688" alt="nap-watercolor-deco2" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/nap-watercolor-deco2-1024x744.jpg" width="584" height="424"></a></p>
<p>This was one of my first paintings I did in Napier. I did this outside a suburbs shops - so not directly in town. The paper only handles one layer of paint - I really should be using thicker paper. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/draw-hello1.jpg"></p>
<p></a><a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/nap-watercolor-land.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1689" alt="nap-watercolor-land" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/nap-watercolor-land-1024x744.jpg" width="584" height="424"></a></p>
<p>My least favorite out of the lot.</p>
<p><a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/nap-watercolor-land2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1690" alt="nap-watercolor-land2" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/nap-watercolor-land2-1024x744.jpg" width="584" height="424"></a></p>
<p>Right side of the previous painting. Capturing the trees scaling into the foreground. A nice blue would help. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/draw-hello1.jpg"></p>
<p></a><a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/nap-watercolor-street2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1691" alt="nap-watercolor-street2" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/nap-watercolor-street2-1024x744.jpg" width="584" height="424"></a></p>
<p>One of the major differences I notice with painting is the lack of detail I'm able to get - with drawing I can capture small drawings - painting tends to be more of a impression. I think I will always enjoy drawing more. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/draw-hello1.jpg"></p>
<p></a><a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/nap-watercolor-street.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1692" alt="nap-watercolor-street" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/nap-watercolor-street-1024x744.jpg" width="584" height="424"></a></p>
<p>Another street view. Paints great with how quickly it spreads. Roger always said 'painting is easier because it spreads quickly' when comparing it to painting. Very true - I can cover more of a area with paint than draw and not get tired. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/draw-hello1.jpg"></p>
<p></a><a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/nap-watercolor-landbest.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1693" alt="nap-watercolor-landbest" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/nap-watercolor-landbest-1024x744.jpg" width="584" height="424"></a></p>
<p>This was a favorite landscape. The reds in the sea helps. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/draw-hello1.jpg"></p>

<p>That's all for now folks.</p></body></html></p>

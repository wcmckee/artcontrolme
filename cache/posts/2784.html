<p>I noticed this photo in the morning, I did a quick check of RedditGetsDrawn and noticed this images straight away. It's a full figure, and an interesting background with the trees and ground. Certainly something I can work with. The skin tones aren't washed out either - there is a range to work with. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Smmt5sJ.png"></p>

I had a weird body posistion curled up in bed for this. The lines are rougher than usual. There is more line, even unnecessary line.<a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/redddits-bw.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2787" alt="redddits-bw" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/redddits-bw.png" width="800" height="776"></a>Grayscale. Focused on the character with the gray rather than the background. Struggled with elements of the character - the hands especially. Happy with the tones in the facial area.</p>

Used a new purple for the 'white' areas. This looks fine when mixed with a range of tones. I tried the purple for the hair as well but it didn't look correct so switched to an orange. Suits it better. For the jacket a red was used, no tones though. In the background - green for the floor and blue for the sky.</p>

<p><html><body><p>When I was in Wellington I visited DeviantArt.com and went on the DrawPlz forums. It has been months since I've worked from them... it was fun.. something different and fresh.</p>

<p>Draw the item to your left. This was when I was sitting at a Bench... so had an empty cup of tea and my 2nd moniter setup. The lack of different brushes (or custom!) is limiting. Also I don't have the pressure working on the DA Client.... Must be able to config it to work though</p>

<p>Someones Rabbit type creature that I drew. Practicing envroiments in the background with the long blue marks. This could be worked up further with a lighter blue color to contrast with the dark blue. Other colors wouldn't hurt either - yellows and reds.</p>

<p>And finally a portrait of someones character. Out of all the paintings I did on DA, this is my favorite.</p>
<p>I still have yet to scan in my sketchbook to Wellington. I started it over the weekend but had problems with the format. A jump drive would do me well... or at least get cloud storage sorted... I should be able to use my webhosting for it.</p>
<p>More updates later in the week....</p>

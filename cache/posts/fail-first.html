<p><html><body><p>Still no drawing or painting to upload despite making a return today to TLC. In the morning we watched slideshows and talked about life drawing. It was much the same as normal for Â the class. Good to catch up with old faces and met new ones though! Gonna crash Marcy Marcs on Thursday.</p>
<p>In the afternoon Dan modeled for the class (clothed). I felt horrible so went to the common room and played Half Life 2 and did a bit in Blender for the rest of the afternoon. Just wasn't the time. I'm hoping next week I can get into the flow - it was quite a depressing afternoon thinking - geeze, why don't I have the motivation to draw. Setups also the other. I didn't plan out to draw today.</p>
<p>Here's a drawing I did in bed the other day.</p>

<p>This was all done in colored pencil. No reference, just sketching down ideas. I think this is really important. Too often I get trapped into using a reference and it's just nice and free to work out of my head. Especially using it as and exercise to get to sleep!</p>
<p>The Robot inspired head I animated. I'd like to create a talking model in Blender - especially a robot like this one. I might take this idea into Blender tomorrow and explore.</p>
<p>That's all for tonight. Goodnight.</p></body></html></p>

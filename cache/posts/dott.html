<p><html><body><a href="http://www.fengzhudesign.com/">Feng Zhu</a> is a talented lad. His blog and Youtube channel are a wealth of information  In October last year he posted two paintings of remade video game shots. Classic, but certainly dated with graphics. He posted two paintings - <a href="http://fengzhudesign.blogspot.co.nz/2012/10/dott-remake.html">DOTT</a> and <a href="http://fengzhudesign.blogspot.co.nz/2012/10/monkey-island.html">Monkey Island</a>. To be honest, I haven't played them. I'm not a puzzle fan - I do enjoy Adventure games such as Heavy Rain and The Walking Dead, but as soon as puzzles are involved, I'm out.</p>
<p>Feng Zhu also posted a video of a painting he did for the game - Flashback! Another classic game...</p>

<p>So being inspired by all these repainting of classic games I had to do one myself - for a game that one of my Twitter friends mentioned. Day of the Tentacle.</p>

<p>I found a screenshot from the game during my search. It's still visible on my painting - at the top.</p>
<p>I had just finished my <a title="anna new color sample" href="http://artcontrol.me/?p=2278">new color palette painting</a> and decided to pixel grab again. There are some colors here I'd like to use again - the orange and reds in the clock. The environment is washed out. all the color in the characters. The green and pink contrasts greatly but has potential - maybe use a  range of tones. Interesting purples with the walls.</p>

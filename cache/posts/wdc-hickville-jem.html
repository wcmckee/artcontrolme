<p>I am writing this from my new Raspberry Pi 3. I am using the built in wifi, which is awesome. It is
faster than the pi2 which makes web browsing great as the pi2 will slightly sluggish when web 
browsing. 
I have yet to switch to a pi3 for my portable digital painting. I think I am going to keep with the
pi2 for now since the power usage on pi3 is quite high. I will use the pi3 as a desktop computer 
with the plan to get a touch screen for it in the future. </p>
<p>Here is recent artwork. I have been remixing works from jemsshed, hicksville and xkcd.</p>
<p><img alt="about" src="/galleries/2016/03/04/about.png" /></p>
<p>About page I sketched. This is for my Nikola talk that will be happening on 14th March. If you
are in the Waikato come along! </p>
<p><img alt="anansiboys" src="/galleries/2016/03/04/anansiboys.png" /></p>
<p>I finished Anansi Boys by Neil Gaiman. It was excellent. I think I enjoyed it more than 
American Gods as I was more engaged. The story was excellent.</p>
<p><img alt="itwords" src="/galleries/2016/03/04/gitwords.png" /></p>
<p>This was drawn at Writers Den Chartwell. It was only their 2nd meeting. There was an excellent turnout,
including 4 children. People talked about good writing, and bad writing, showing examples of both.
They also shared pieces of their writing based on the theme animals. The theme for next time is 
Mystery. I don't think I will make the next meeting as I am attending Ruby Camp. </p>
<p><img alt="hicksville" src="/galleries/2016/03/04/hicksville.png" /></p>
<p>This was remixed from <a href="http://hicksvillecomics.com">hicksvillecomics</a>. I found this artist thanks 
to a list of artists on the Creative Commons website. </p>
<p><img alt="kurtmccarthy" src="/galleries/2016/03/04/kurtmccarthy.png" /></p>
<p>GetsDrawn portrait with sketches on the left. Included is a bottle of my brothers hot sauce. This 
was drawn when I was at my brothers.</p>
<p><img alt="musicback" src="/galleries/2016/03/04/musicback.png" /></p>
<p>Another piece remixed from Hicksville.</p>
<p><img alt="ikola" src="/galleries/2016/03/04/nikola.png" /></p>
<p>Sketching my Nikola talk. This will be taken into Inkscape and converted into a vector file. Areas
will be split into a series of slides. </p>
<p><img alt="rainstart" src="/galleries/2016/03/04/rainstart.png" /></p>
<p>I have continued to remix Jemsshed artwork. This was inspired from her comic Rain. I did my 
own sketches for the rain, not using her rain illustrations as reference</p>
<p><img alt="wabbitcuddle" src="/galleries/2016/03/04/wabbitcuddle.png" /></p>
<p>Another referece from Jemsshed this was of a rabbit and girl cuddling. Cute. </p>
<p><img alt="wander" src="/galleries/2016/03/04/wander.png" /></p>
<p>Next panel of Rain. Merged several panels of Jems into one. </p>
<p><img alt="windwords" src="/galleries/2016/03/04/windwords.png" /></p>
<p>I got bored and switched to xkcd reference. Lawrance was spose to do a talk on Git at the next 
wlug meeting. I am going to talk about the Raspberry Pi 3, not sure if he still is going to 
talk on Git.</p>
<p>A talk on licences would be great at wlug, something a bit difference. Creative Commons licences 
could be covererd. Would be great to get someone in to talk about it. </p>
<p><img alt="write-den-chartwell" src="/galleries/2016/03/04/write-den-chartwell.png" /></p>
<p>Final sketch. This was completed at Writers Den Chartwell. Notes at the bottom from discussion.</p>
<p>One of the kids at writers den mentioned they have a list of jail words in their class - words that
they are not allowed to use. I am looking forward to seeing this list. It makes me what to write 
something that includes these words. Similar to the xkcd book What If?</p>

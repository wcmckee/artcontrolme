<p><html><body><p>I spent several days in Christchurch recently but am now back in Levin.</p>
<p>Sadly I left my drawing book in Christchurch and have not drawn since.</p>
<p>When I was in Christchurch I did buy a new Raspberry Pi 2 B computer. I had it running Debian and was very impressed with the speed.</p>
<p>It is so fast that it allows me to do digital painting in GIMP just the same as on my desktop computer or laptop.</p>
<p>I don't have a monitor in Levin for the Pi so have not been able to do more - but here is what I created in Christchurch</p>

<p>Pi Art. The term used by shop keeper when I picked up my new Pi. Testing marks and getting use to the Pi.</p>

<p>On the Thursday in Christchurch I went to the Community Centre where I drew with someone. Taking some of these ideas from the drawings into GIMP.</p>

<p>Greyscale tonal layer.</p>
<p>Enjoy. It may be good for me to do some digital painting on the laptop. No monitor for the Pi currently.</p>

<p><html><body><p>I've been taking photos. The majority of these have been landscape or street scene, but I have taken some photos of people. You can check out my new stock photography website - <a href="http://freshfigure.com/art/">FreshFigure</a>.</p>
<p>For this painting I used several of my photographs and painted characters. I normally paint enviorments so it's always refreshing to paint characters. Here goes:</p>
<p><a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/akl-char-line.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2131" alt="akl-char-line" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/akl-char-line-1024x512.jpg" width="625" height="312"></a></p>
<p>Line. The four figures are all the same height with the two portraits slightly wider than the figures. I especilly enjoyed doing the line on portrait with the tongue out - it's very unusal and nothing like a normal portrait. Yay for differences. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/akl-char-tone.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2132" alt="akl-char-tone" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/akl-char-tone-1024x512.jpg" width="625" height="312"></a></p>
<p>Grayscale tone. I focused on skin and hair - missing the legs on the left two figures. I went in with the middle gray and just covered areas before going in with dark to the hair areas. I used a light gray in certain areas of the skin to increase the contrast.</p>
<p><a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/akl-char-col.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2133" alt="akl-char-col" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/akl-char-col-1024x512.jpg" width="625" height="312"></a>Color. I dropped opacity to 30% and covered the skin with yellow. Next was red for the darks (just laying over that yellow). Finally I used two shades of blue for the back wall and a green for the floor.</p>

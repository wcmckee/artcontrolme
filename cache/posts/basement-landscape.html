<p><html><body><p>Since my move I've had room to paint. I never painted in my last flat, except for a little in my journal. I don't really consider this painting though - painting is working large on a board.</p>
<p>Since I have the space I've setup  of paintings next to my computer</p>
<p>I started with gouache. Then moved onto acrylic. Once I'm happy with the acrylic layer I'll lay down oils.</p>
<p>All of these paintings have been recorded - I've only uploaded one to youtube...</p>

<p>I'll do a voice over and upload the others at some point.</p>

<p>I wasn't happy with this as a gouache but once I turned it to this:</p>
<p><a style="font-style: normal; line-height: 24px; text-decoration: underline;" href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/120620-213030.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-556" style="border-color: #bbbbbb; background-color: #eeeeee;" title="120620-213030" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/120620-213030.png" alt="" width="1024" height="615"></a></p>
<p>Extremely happy with this. I felt I was able to give it real depth to areas with tone. The brush `I used was resemble small. I brought it last year when I got my oil paints. The hair on it is thick so it can hold a decent amount of paint. Helps to mix multi tones onto the brush and flip the brush in order to get a different tone. Bit like the technique that Roger tea<a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/land2.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-560" title="land2" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/land2-1024x655.png" alt="" width="584" height="373"></a></p>
<p>I was happier with the gouache painting then the previous. Maybe because it had stronger perspective.</p>

<p>Acrylic paint added. I wasn't on the same flow as the first acrylic...  had lost my wind. I wouldn't say this ones bad... I just feel it isn;'t as strong as the previous. With some more time I can get it up to scratch.</p>

<p>This was a bunch of portraits but I didn't like it so decided to turn it into a landscape. I've already started the landscape with the goache. It's a bit of a mess since its a mix of landscape and portraits.... the perspective isn't in there. I was hoping that acrylic would hellp...</p>

<p>And the acrylic applied. It needs more areas defined. Currently there is too much empty areas. More layers to add depth would help. I'm using a larger brush then the other acrylic - helpful to cover areas quicklly. Working with a slightly smaller brush and adding more contrast to areas will help.</p></body></html></p>

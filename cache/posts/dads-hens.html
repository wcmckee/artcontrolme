<p><html><body><p>It's been a nice day. Went for a walk and took photographs. Pretty flowers, and food! This afternoon I decided to sit down and do another painting (I really don't produce enough paintings).</p>
<p>So here's the painting. Dads Hens:</p>
<p><a href="http://freshfigure.com/art/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/DSC_4826.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-551" title="DSC_4826" alt="" src="http://freshfigure.com/art/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/DSC_4826-1024x682.jpg" width="625" height="416"></a>Reference I used. This is a photo I took recently of my Fathers Chickens. You can view more of the photos over<a href="http://freshfigure.com/art/?p=556"> here</a>. I used this photograph as reference on my laptop monitor - and painted on the desktop.</p>

<p>When was the last time I drew a animal on the computer? It's great to draw a different subject. This was very quick to get down and certainly helps my visual library.</p>
<p><a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/choock-bw.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2264" alt="choock-bw" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/choock-bw-925x1024.jpg" width="625" height="691"></a>Gray scale tone. I started with the eye- the darkest gray and worked out from there. I decided later it was too dark and make it lighter. That's the great thing about working digital - if it isn't working then just paint over it. I used two tones for the majority of the Hen, bringing in a third later for dark highlights. The background, a layer of light gray.</p>
<p><a style="color: #0f3647" href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/choock-color.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2265" alt="choock-color" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/choock-color-925x1024.jpg" width="625" height="691"></a>Color now. Used the same colors as the painting I did earlier today. I'm really enjoying these two yellows and how well they work together. No red in here. Maybe I could of created an environment for the Hen to be in. Poor thing, just covered with blueness.</p>
<p>Here's the video to go along with the painting:</p>

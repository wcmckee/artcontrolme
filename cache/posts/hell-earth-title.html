<p>wow, its been awhile since I've updated this site. I've been drawing a little, but most of the focus has been going into game development. Unity is going well, currently in the middle of 7 day first person shooter - 7DFPS. Mine went well at the start but hiot a wall now and need something fresh. Creating ew 3d models and texture, and rig is one of my best options. Something fun and different.<a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/hell2.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-5192" alt="hell2" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/hell2-1024x687.png" width="625" height="419"></a></body></html></p>

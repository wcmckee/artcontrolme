<p><html><body><p>Awake nice and early this morning. I decided to get a painting out of the wait straight away. I spent yesterday working with Unity - taking both my 3d and 2d artwork into the engine. It made me want to build something in a day - maybe for game jam where I make make everything from scratch - pencil sketch - digital painting - 3d blender - then finally unity. I think it will be a good challenge  Often I just recycle my old art assets. This will be especially helpful for the 3d.</p>
<p>Here's the painting -<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-449" style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1;" title="DSC_4150" alt="" src="http://freshfigure.com/art/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/DSC_4150-1024x682.jpg" width="625" height="416"></p>
<p>The photo reference. I took this photo several days ago in Levin. It's a alleyway I often walk down. I'm happy with the photo, and photos I'm happy with are more likely to be turned into art. Here's the art:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2223" alt="ALLY-COLORBURST-LIN" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/ALLY-COLORBURST-LIN1-1024x512.jpg" width="625" height="312"></p>
<p>Line was minimal on this. Perhaps too minimal. I get better line if I mix reference together. Working with one reference isn't enough. I added in a couple of characters to give the scene something more, and to show some scale.</p>

<p>Tone to flesh the piece out. Usual techniques applied - started with the figures in dark and worked off there giving a range of tone to the piece. The vegetation looks strange. I didn't use proper reference for it. Maybe I should of refereed back to some sketch book works?</p>

I had fun mixing the blue, red and yellow together. This was mainly on the vegataion areas - they parts that I felt were weak.</p></body></html></p>

<p><html><body><p>I've spent the majority of my time working on GIMP - digital painting. Mostly just doodles but Â last night I did work from <a href="http://www.pixelovely.com/gesture/figuredrawing.php">pixellovely</a>. I've decided I like GIMP much more then Photoshop. It's friendly. Photoshop is just yuck.<a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/tube.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-492" title="tube" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/tube-724x1024.png" alt="" width="584" height="825"></a></p>
<p>This is experimenting with shapes in perspective. During the term of life drawing I had an increasing interest in shapes after my time working in Blender (something I havn't worked on for a while.... I need to do more!). Taking these ideas into digital has been fun. I'll work on developing this further.</p>

<p>Pixellovely sketches. I'm working with two minute timers on this. Again similar colors to what I've been doing in the past. I'll aim to spent a hour or so everyday working on these. Allows me to keep up with the figure works without attending life drawing classes.</p>
<p>That's all for tonight. I've also started work on a painting - on a large long board. So far it's just in gouache but I'll develop it further with acrylic and oil paint. I don't have a photo of this currently but will take a photo tomorrow when there is decent light. Going to work on a collubrath painting with Andrew as well - have about 5 of these boards left.</p></body></html></p>

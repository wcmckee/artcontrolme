<p><html><body><p>Took a pastel work from Whaihanga into GIMP and performed a line, grayscale, and color traceover. It has been a very long time since I have done this - not since I have my old Medium Wacom tablet. The small tablet handles the line trace fine.
Anyway, one of the main reasons why I did this was for concept house designs to model out in 3d. It's always easier to produce 2d works first to get a feeling into what I want to create.</p>
<p>And without further ado. Enjoy -</p>

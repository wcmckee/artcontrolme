<p>This was one of my favorite drawings I did well in Wellington - Waterfront on Sunday morning. When I lived in Wellington I would often make it into the Te Papa market to buy fruit and veges - and get some sketching done. It was lovely to do this again.</p>
<p>Here's the painting process:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1456" style="color: #333333; font-style: normal; line-height: 24px; margin-top: 0.4em;" title="ca-water-org" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/ca-water-org-1024x409.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="233"></p>
<p></p><div>I started with mashing the two photographs together. I worked the same size as the previous work - 6000px by 200px. It's a great long format that works well for these ladscape type works.<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1457" title="ca-water-line" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/ca-water-line-1024x409.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="233">Line added. I kept with the black line but I should explore different colors - browns might be good. Using something that's not black will help remove the cartoon feel I get.<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1458" style="color: #333333; font-style: normal; line-height: 24px; border-color: #bbbbbb; background-color: #eeeeee;" title="ca-water-bw" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/ca-water-bw-1024x409.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="233"> Tone added. I used a light and mid gray for the objects and a dark gray for areas of the water and the figure in the foreground</p>
<p><a style="font-style: normal; line-height: 24px; text-decoration: underline;" href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/ca-water-col.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1459" style="border-color: #bbbbbb; margin-top: 0.4em; background-color: #eeeeee;" title="ca-water-col" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/ca-water-col-1024x409.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="233"></a>And finally color - same color as previous works. I want to create several of these works everyday - using the same colors (though I leave room for more colors to happen - especially lights and darks of current colors). I kept the figure in black as it helped give the sense of perspective. Looking at this now - more reds could of been using on the right side. Maybe even capture the figure with some reds. Would highlights of light on the figure help?</p>

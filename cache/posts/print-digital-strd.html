<p><html><body><p>Digital works that I worked on last night. I have the flu so havn't been drawing (or even leaving the house). I'll keep warm and recovery should be fine.</p>
<p>Here are some JPGs and GIFs....</p>
<p><a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/first-printy.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-869" title="first-printy" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/first-printy.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="1132"></a>This was originally created in Printmaking in 2010. Several lithograph prints were created from it. I decided to open it in GIMP and produce a paint over. Though it's the same process as the sketchbook to digital works I've decided to use a different yellow - to explore greens.</p>

<p>Sketchbook development here. Interesting mix of trees and buildings. No blue. Maybe it should be added.</p>

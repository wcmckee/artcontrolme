<p><html><body><p>Here are several drawings I did well reading the Frank Hebert book - DUNE.
Rather than working from reference these works are from imagination. I do this in real time - read a passage from the book and draw what it's saying (often DESCRIBING a character or environment).</p>
<p>I've been using bio pen for my work. It's quick, bold and allows me to WRITE more. Drawings are photographed at various stages - line and tone. Convert to black and white, just to get rid of that color temp problem. Make everything the same.</p>

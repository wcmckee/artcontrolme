<p><html><body><p>Spent the day on Saturday putting together Adam 'Ted' Frankenstein in Unity3d. It's three scenes linked together with a next button. If you want to play it - check it out on <a href="http://gamejolt.com/games/adventure/adam-ted-frankenstein/29292/">GameJolt</a></p>
<p>I've continued the game dev thing after releasing this - back into MyPaint for digital sketching.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.epicgamejam.com/">Epic Jam</a>Â is a jam I noticed that I wouldn't mind making something for. It's unique in the fact that subthemes are added as the jam happens. The main theme is - First Time.</p>
<p>I've continued some Adam 'Ted' Frankenstein drawings/paintings, and it would do me good to work on Adam 'Ted' Frankenstein further.</p>
<p>Anyway, here's some MyPaint digital line, followed by a grayscale paintover in GIMP. Next is to take this art into Blender.</p>

From life. Started with a pencil then colored with colored pencils - matching the color as best as I can. Quite happy with this - really looking forward to the life drawing next week!</p>

I will take these ideas and apply them to blender. The first cycle is a basic walk cycle - a large lift of the leg as its brought forward and the front is brought backwards.</p>
<p>The second animation is a simple movement of rectangles out then a flick of the end - followed by quickly bringing it back in and back at the start.</p>
<p>Maybe it could be a looping animation of something being dropped.</p>

<p><html><body><p>Back in Wellington. Nice to be back I guess. I've been enjoying colored pencil, yesterday I didn't work with Blender - instead sketched in my visual diary. I've got a strong mindset to take these ideas into Blender. Something is brewing.</p>
<p>Back in 2010 I got really into the Yeah Yeah Yeahs and I frequently drew the band.</p>

<p>This was one of the reference photos I completed a drawing of. In order to compare my drawing and check development I redrew this photo. Here's what I came up with:</p>
<p><a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/120415-053540.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-278" title="120415-053540" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/120415-053540-e1334425237509.jpg" alt="" width="768" height="1024"></a></p>
<p>Strong straight lines, color used for tone. I love this color scene - red, yellow, brown for the characters and blues for negative space. Several sketches of wire frames to help understand walk cycles further.</p>

<p>Less character based and more animation feel. I'm not sure what I'm doing with this but I'm going to take these into blender today and experiment.</p></body></html></p>

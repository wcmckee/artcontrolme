<p><html><body><p>Georgette was the model on Monday. I found my 8b chunk of graphite so used that - especially helpful for warming up. Oil pastel was also used throughout the day, and plenty of dragon killing during breaks.</p>
<p>Next week will be the final week.<a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/120521-162110.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-451" title="120521-162110" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/120521-162110.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768"></a>The theme was clothed, which I wasn't expecting. I've never been a fan of clothed model sessions. In nude I trust. I'd be interested drawing costumes but I felt the cloth that Georgette was using just covered her body and didn't add anything. Disappointed.</p>
<p>That aside I tried to make the most of the model<a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/120521-162142.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-452" title="120521-162142" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/120521-162142.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768"></a></p>
<p>No colored pencil. Instead using oil pastel for the tone. Oil pastel is fantastic, it spreads quickly and doesn't smudge or cause problems.</p>

<p>I've been playing Skyrim. Good times.</p>
<p><a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/120521-162233.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-454" title="120521-162233" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/120521-162233.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768"></a>Dan noticed these and said they were really working. The figure on the left is looking too muddy, I don't like it.</p>

<p>I really wanted to practice techniques like this. Capture full body, and using tone fill in lights and darks. Typical color scheme</p>

<p>Strong portraits. Must be that pratice from Saturday night. Cmpletely different style then the portraits. This is my favourite work of the day.</p>
<p><a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/120521-162409.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-457" title="120521-162409" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/120521-162409.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768"></a></p>
<p>For the last part of the day the model hid areas of her body behind a sheet with light behind. This cauesed an interesting shadow effect.</p>
<p>The drawing on the right is drawn from imagination. I'd like to practice further with recalling poses and such from memory.</p>
<p>Not as much life drawing as normal, but I hope you enjoy it anyway.</p></body></html></p>

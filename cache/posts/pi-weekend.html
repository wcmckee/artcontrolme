<p>Mixture of monster robotic characters and portraits from GetsDrawn. I've added their username near the portrait.</p>

<p>It's been a long time since artcontrol.me: artwork of William Mckee has had a new logo. Using the Raspberry Pi and my Wacom tablet I traced over an old logo - to give it new life. This is the line layer. It's a little rough and quick, but the logo will cleanup on the grayscale tonal and color layers. I would never use a line layer as a logo.</p>

<p>Grayscale tonal. The R in artcontrol and the smaller text is a mess.</p>

<p>Colour. Using Green on figure.</p>

<p>I will end with this. Red line layer. Characters for the gamejam Adventure Jam. It goes for two weeks. I'm not sure how much I'll get done - so far I've only produced paintings. The name of my game is <em>Hunt For Naples Yellow. </em>The name is inspired from the film <em>The Hunt For Red October </em>and named after my digital painting/python dev pi machine - naplesyellow.</p>
<p>Naming all servers after colours.</p>
<p>Crayons.</p>

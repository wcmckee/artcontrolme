<p>Walk cycle is in there- even if it's rough. I know how to create actions and dublicate them - now I need to learn how to create multiply actions and 'link' them together. When I have something like that happening I'll feel great.</p>
<p>I need to explore modeling further. I'm going to keep it simple with low poly modeling. Textures - create legit UV maps for my models, using my own artwork.</p>
<p>Learn more about Rigging.</p>

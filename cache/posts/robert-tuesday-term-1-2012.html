<p><html><body><p>Six hours of life drawing with Robert. Normally it would be three hours on Monday/Tuesday/Wednesday but this term it's switched around. Fine with me as I get the chance to jump into Christenas class for the rest of the week. So much life models - but great to end the term with a bang</p>
<p>I spent the day carrying on with oil pastels - seemed fitting to keep the development and exploration happening. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/DSCF5530-Custom.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-214" title="DSCF5530 (Custom)" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/DSCF5530-Custom.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600"></a></p>
<p>Graphite 8b warmups. Some tone is applied to areas. Alot of this is done blind which I feel I've been neglecting. Good practice. I like the strong straight line work on some of these. These were just warmups and I switched to oil pastel for the rest of the day.</p>
<p><a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/DSCF5527-Custom.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-209" title="DSCF5527 (Custom)" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/DSCF5527-Custom.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600"></a>Color scene is similar to yesterday I focused on limbs - looking at the light and dark. Those feet on the top left are looking better! It's certainly something I have to focus more on - feet and hands.</p>
<p><a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/DSCF5528-Custom.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-212" title="DSCF5528 (Custom)" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/DSCF5528-Custom-e1332228921375.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="800"></a>This is a good example of a work I started but never had time to finish. You can see the pencil lines. More curvy lines are used in areas - and they work. I'm always worried that the curvy lines wont look at good as my normal straight lines. But I wont know unless I do them!</p>

This was the only time I used white crayon - I used it more yesterday. Rachel said she liked this one, but I don't think much of it.</p>
<p>I talked about the chair with Angelique - I found it helpful using the chair for reference in measuring the anatomy. The proportions are certainly blown up here.</p>
<p>Another couple of pieces that I'm not happy with. Something it just doesn't work.</p>
<p><a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/DSCF5529-Custom1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-217" title="DSCF5529 (Custom)" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/DSCF5529-Custom1.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600"></a></p>
<p>Here I've progressed from yesterday and decided to use a black. This was a hard choice as it destroyed the color somewhat - I got around this by using a cloth and smudging the black into the work. This gave it a more painterly effect and wasn't so over whelming,</p>
<p><a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/DSCF5523-Custom.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-216" title="DSCF5523 (Custom)" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/DSCF5523-Custom.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600"></a>When black is added to yellow green is often created. This happens here. I'm not too sure about this color. It's getting quite muddy.</p>
<p><a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/DSCF5531-Custom.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-210" title="DSCF5531 (Custom)" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/DSCF5531-Custom.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600"></a>This was the long pose. It was spose to go all afternoon (3 hours) but people didn't want a pose that long. Instead this went for 1.5 hours. I'm happy that I got a long pose in that really allowed me to develop the drawing.</p>
<p>I started it how I started the rest - with a pencil outline of the figure and features. Then went in with red for the darks. Yellow for the lights. I covered reds with yellow as well. This helped give it depth. I then added a white - especially on the yellow areas - which hadn't had any layers yet. This gave a interesting texture and of course depth to the piece. Finally finished it off with black - used a hand towel and rubbed into areas. This really brought areas forward. This is the suggestions that Roger would of given me. I wish I had him there today to help!</p>
<p>Tomorrow I may work in my visual diary - I'll switch to pencil and colored pencil if so. Or I'll keep working on an easel with brown paper and pastels. See what happens at the time!</p>

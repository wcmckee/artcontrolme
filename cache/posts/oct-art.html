<p>So it's been months since this blog has been updated. For several months it was shutdown. I was worried at one point that I had lost the 
art from the posts but I had backed it up on a Digital Ocean server. 
Since then the art has been restored but it's not linking correctly on artcontrol.me</p>
<p>I have decided to switch from the wp-contents folder structure to the galleries system that is default in Nikola. </p>
<p>Here are digital paintings that I have completed this month:</p>

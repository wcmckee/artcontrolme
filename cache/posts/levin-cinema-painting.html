<p><html><body><p>Took a recent sketch from my sketchbook into GIMP and did a digital paint over. I recorded the painting and uploaded it to Youtube- with a voice narration over it. I'll make these a regular feature, It's a good habit to get into.</p>
<p>Anyway, onto the painting.</p>

<p>I started with applying line to a recent pencil sketch. The view was of the mall carpark. IÂ started with a 20 px pen and decreased it to 5 px for the detailed areas - especially on the left.</p>

Here I've painted over with tone and removed the line layer. Looking at this now - I could have added more darks to areas - especially the tree and skyline.</p>

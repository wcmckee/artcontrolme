<p><html><body><p>Taken several of my sketches from Auckland and produced a paint over. There was only one new idea here - using the eraser in areas to help tonal value<a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/lynn1pain.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-854" title="lynn1pain" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/lynn1pain.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="561"></a></p>
<p>New Lynn mall. I need a new nip for my pen. It's grinded down and is scrapping on the tablet. It may be part of the problem of unable to get straight lines - my hand has been very jerky. Frustrating. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/lynn1pain.jpg"></p>

<p>Working on this I wished I had taken a photo of the scene - the line was fine - but I had no information for the tone - so just made it up. I guess it works, but it doesn't feel right.</p>
<p>I  used the eraser tool for the blue - capturing a more transparent background. It's been awhile since I've explored these ideas.</p></body></html></p>

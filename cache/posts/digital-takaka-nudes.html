<p><html><body><p>So I scanned in over 50 pages of sketchbook and uploaded it to my blogs server - and only done one post out of it yet. The easiest way to work though these posts will be on my Mums Mac where I can view the files on the local drive easy. I may head around to her place later today to get sorted with this. 50 pages is quite daunting in order and structure, but for now - have some digital paintings that I've been doing with some of the scanned pages. I want to work with my scanned sketchbooks more in GIMP so expect to see more of these works.</p>
<p>I kept with the same color palette that I have been using in all digital painting recently. Everything is simply paint over so no obsevational skills were using - but it gave me good practice with using the tablet... especially those lines!</p>

<p>The standing poses. I use to only focus on certain areas - over time I've wanted to develop full bodys. I'm not sure if I'll take these any further but rather just develop other drawings.</p>

<p>Sitting poses. The box he was sitting on I colored a darker blue, though the backgrounds in all of these works are simple. With the bottom figure I was inspired by the recent red mask attached to characters - he didn't have a defined head so I just covered it in red. The top figure looks very much like James who I use to draw often at TLC<a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/51ps.jpg"></p>

<p></p><div><span style="color: #1b8be0;">A life drawing that I didn't upload with the others, missed this during the upload. It's in fact the final drawing I did of the day. </span></div></p>

<div>The most developed line work in this - though I wish the lines were thicker. Worked backwards somewhat with this - compleleing the blue background, then the yellow/red, lastly finishing up with the black line. The order doesn't really matter since I've been working with 3 layers in these works.</div>

<div>Escape the Sandstorm is the EOW - I've done some sketches that I need to scan in and paint over. Till next time, stay cool honey bun.</div>

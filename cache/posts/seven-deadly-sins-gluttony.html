<p><html><body><p>Theme of the week is happening on Reddit SketchDaily. The theme – Seven Deadly Sins. For the first day it’s Gluttony.
mmmm, food. I had subway for dinner last night as I was given a $20.00 subway card for xmas. Haven’t brought any food since moving into this new flat – might survive on subway again today and shop tomorrow.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to the the art. I did a search on google for gluttony for some reference inspiration. And found this disturbing image. Would be interesting to draw.</p>

<p>The models I get for life drawing are often skinny, especially the male models (James, Robert etc). I’d like to draw a overweight male. Arhhh, more varional on</p>

<p>The GIF. Sadly no video today. I recored it but when I tried to open it after the file was corrupted. I’m using<a href="http://camstudio.org/" target="_blank"> Cam Studio</a>. Maybe I need to check the settings. The files it creates are huge as well – 4 gig for the recording of this painting.</p>
<p>I explored enviorments again, something common in my last few pieces. Any feedback on this would be greatly appreciated. The smudge tool was fun to play around with. Creates transparency and <wbr>distortion. For the seven deadly sins I think this distortion is important – much like the colors – brown, gray – sickly. With the green I tried a impression style – blobs of green to make up a area. Maybe I could use this same technique with figures as well?</wbr></p>

<p>Here’s the final. Does his head look like ET?</p>

<p><html><body><p>I am currently in Auckland, weather has been decent - allowed me to get outside and sketch lots. Here are some digital works I did when in Waihi - reference is recent drawings in my sketchbook. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/DSC08298s.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-804" title="DSC08298s" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/DSC08298s-577x1024.png" alt="" width="577" height="1024"></a></p>
<p>A new color induduced - Green. This was a doodle page, but I was able to paint over it and extract the information I wanted.<a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/DSC08298s.png"></p>

Similar idea to the Auckland painting - but this time mighty Levin. I have to do one of these of Auckland. A blue shade of Auckland. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/cath2.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-806" title="cath2" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/cath2.png" alt="" width="800" height="764"></a></p>
<p>Catherines Character. Just a simple paint over. My lines are improving. It's important that I work on that line every day - especially with digital, harder to make a perfect line than traditional.</p>
<p>There is a digital camera here so tomorrow I may photograph some of drawings of Auckland and get them uploaded. Tonight I'll work on some digital paintings.</p></body></html></p>

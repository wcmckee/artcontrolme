<p>For New Years my flatmate asked me to go to town with him. I took my drawing gear - sketchbook, hb pencil and the new promarkers I got. I ended up working on several works during the night.</p>

<p>The was a portrait that a old guy asked me to draw of his friend to see how fast I was. I was fast and he was impressed. He liked how the colors on the page changed so quickly. I guess that is why the promarkers are so awesome, they are quick to get color down. I am certainly very happy with these colors but need a light blue.</p>

I ended up working on the color last night - certainly makes great skin tones.</p>

The theme for EOW is <a href="http://www.conceptart.org/forums/showthread.php?t=273408">Atomic Bomb Testing Town</a>. It seemed very appropriate to work from Fallout reference for the concept art. Enjoying the suburb creation.</p>
<p>Have a great year.</p>

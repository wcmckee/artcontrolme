<p><html><body><p>Update on Blender works. I've started taking ideas from my sketches and modeling them in Blender. Since I so often draw street scenes it's about time I work on creating them from my art. Real streets, drawn, then re-imagined in a 3d environment.</p>

<p>I wanted something simple that I could repeat - so I modeled a power pole and a light. Buildings were build later. I used alot of the same assest as previous works - such as the texture for the floor and continued to use the same red, yellow and blue in painting. I'll like to keep these colors and develop a world. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/street1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1145" title="street1" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/street1-1024x587.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="334"></a>As you can see I have added a little water mark to the bottom right. This is something I will continue to do in all my artwork - just something small to link it back to me. Seeing it now - I shouldd drop the opacity the logo. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/street2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1146" title="street2" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/street2-1024x594.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="338"></a></p>
<p>On the left you can see the buildings. These are not in the animated film as they were added a later point. I'll work these into a future cut.</p>

<p>The video I made. I've already started expanding on ideas started in this. It needs more particle effects - rain and snow would be cool. Needs detail - more polygons to make up the scene. Story is important as well - something I often struggle with.</p></body></html></p>

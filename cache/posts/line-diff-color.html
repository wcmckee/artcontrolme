<p><html><body><p>Three works for Tuesday morning. I've continued with just line - no gray-scale or color tonal layers.
</p><p style="text-align: left;">One suggestion I had from my Sister was to use a range of different colors with the line - to separate and define objects. This worked well - I used a dark green for the grass areas in the painting. Dark blue for the sky and water, and a light yellow for skin tones. The red acts as a base. I'll continue experimenting with a range of colors in the line.</p></p>

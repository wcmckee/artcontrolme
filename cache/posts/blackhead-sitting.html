<p>Reference photo. Decent lighting - enough shadow for two or three tones in the face. The background is lacking somewhat, but it doesn't matter as it's going to be made.</p>

<p>Here's a critic:</p>
<p></p><blockquote>The left eye should be below the right eye.  The nose is much shorter than it should be. Bottom lip is too fat.</blockquote></p>
<p>Good points. I need to be careful with my observation skills to capture what's really in the image. Comparing the two I've mirrored the image - not only are the eyes opposite but the hair line as-well.</p>
<p>A new shape has been  used recently in my background - squares. I use these square shapes in both the sky and land.</p>

<p>Fixed the mirror problem in the face. The line layer is my first chance to get it right, and often don't get it right on my first chance. That's why I get a second with the gray-scale tone layer. Isn't life wonderful with all these chances?</p>
<p>Custom made flat brush has been used for this whole piece. The opposite to this is the circle chalk brush that I often use. To be honest I prefer the sharp, flat look over a round. Mixing the two together works wonders.</p>

<p>Everyone I've painting on Reddit recently have been turned into redheads. I don't think that's a bad thing because redheads are pretty damn amazing.</p>
<p>Color is the layer I struggle with the most. Maybe using more tones of a color will help. I use two, maybe three tones if I'm lucky of each color. Increasing this number would help with detail and depth of painting deeply.</body></html></p>

This is mostly the ceiling. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/110.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-879" title="1" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/110-761x1024.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="785"></a>Working vertical, gives an interesting perspective. Much more detail in this area then the roof. People were blocking areas so I had to work around that somewhat. Attempted to capture the wood bark texture on the containers - spreading it to other container structures. I'll do a paint over of these works tonight or in the morning. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/32.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-881" title="3" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/32-e1345791517762-1024x739.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="421"></a></p>

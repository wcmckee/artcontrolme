<p><html><body><p>Today I arrived back in Wellington. I attended Vincents. It was a female model – Lyn. Afterwards I found out that she was the mother of Pri – a girl who I went to TLC with.</p>
<p>I painted - Gouache</p>
<p><a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/DSCF5256-Custom.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-92" title="DSCF5256 (Custom)" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/DSCF5256-Custom.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600"></a></p>
<p>Photo of new watercolor brush – it’s a bright. And the gouache. Primary Yellow, Ultramarine Blue, and Burnt Sienna. 25ml tubes, costing 12 dollars each. These will last and I look forward to creating works with them.</p>

<p>Here’s the first poses layed. These poses were 2 mins, standing. I changed color for each pose. This reminds me of the life acrylic painting. I was treating the acrylic paint very much like watercolor – think washes – allowing it to drip. Similar properties. The opaite nature of gouache will make it a interesting study.</p>

<p>Portraits. These two were 5 min poses. I like that painting is quick – unlike colored pencil where it takes a long time to cover a distance – painting is quick. Strong straight lines created – especially on the leg. I do like those lines.</p>

<p>A thumb study. I attempted blind painting – not looking at the painting paper but focused on the model. I’m going to practice this more with my life drawing and painting. I’m getting better at drawing/painting with my right hand so will practice blind more as well</p>
<p><a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/DSCF5253-Custom.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-97" title="DSCF5253 (Custom)" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/DSCF5253-Custom.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="600"></a></p>
<p>Looks a bit messy. Abstract painting anyone? This was done blind.</p>
<p><a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/DSCF5254-Custom.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-98" title="DSCF5254 (Custom)" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/DSCF5254-Custom.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="600"></a></p>
<p>Some interesting lines created here. I like the leg coming down – and the bend leg in front. This gouache is working for me.</p>
<p><a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/DSCF5255-Custom.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-99" title="DSCF5255 (Custom)" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/DSCF5255-Custom.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="600"></a></p>
<p>A longer pose. One of my favorite works of the night. Beginning to mix colors – beautiful green created. You can never not have enough blues. The negative space helps create a setting for the model. With the quick spread of the paint this is easy to create.</p>
<p><a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/DSCF5239-Custom.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-100" title="DSCF5239 (Custom)" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/DSCF5239-Custom.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="600"></a></p>
<p>Smile! Here I’ve warmed up and started to create finished works. This work is hanging on my wall. Wonderful from a distance. The figure is subtle the negative space (blue) creates a interesting shape that leads your eye around the piece. I like how it’s cut into several different shapes – build from triangles. This is why I like flat brushes – creates a sharp and defining edge.</p>

<p>A sitting pose. Back facing me. This was the first time I had painted/drawn Lyn so was very refreshing. It’s what I enjoy about Vincents – a range in models.</p>
<p><a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/DSCF5237-Custom.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-102" title="DSCF5237 (Custom)" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/DSCF5237-Custom.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="600"></a></p>
<p>My favorite pose of the night. Lyn managed to hold this upside down pose for 10 mins. Very impressive.</p>
<p>I also painted landscapes today that I will upload in a future post.</p></body></html></p>

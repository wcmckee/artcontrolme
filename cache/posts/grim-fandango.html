<p><html><body><p>I need to update this blog more often. I have many artworks to get uploaded. Maybe I need someone to write for me? If you are interested in any writing positions, please email me. I also need a theme makeover. Maybe connect the three blogs together. What other sites could I create?</p>
<p>Anyway, here is a painting I did before I left to Hamilton:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2307" alt="GIMF-LINE" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/GIMF-LINE1.jpg" width="6400" height="4000">Another game related shot - this time Grim Fandango. I took some design liberty with this work and rearranged items - and leaving some characters out. Type is always fun to paint. Maybe I'll</p>
<p><a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/GIMF-BW.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2308" alt="GIMF-BW" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/GIMF-BW.jpg" width="6400" height="4000"></a>Tone. It's interesting looking at this and comparing it to the work I just completed - my tones have really improved since I've done this painting marathon.</p>
<p><a style="color: #0f3647;" href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/GIMF-COLOR.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2310" alt="GIMF-COLOR" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/GIMF-COLOR.jpg" width="6400" height="4000"></a>Color. I haven't been working with color, instead focusing on graysale tones. Once I return to color I believe my tones will be stronger.</p>
<p>Anyway, I hope you like the painting. Till next time - <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/adventure-8-tone.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2463" alt="adventure-8-tone" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/adventure-8-tone.jpg" width="8000" height="4000"></a></p>
<p>Rock on.</p></body></html></p>

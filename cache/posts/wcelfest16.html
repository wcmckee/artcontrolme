<p>Another week, another conference. This week I got along to WCELfest. It's an
digital elearning conference held at Waikato University. </p>
<p>Here are the paintings that I created during the event:  </p>
<p><img alt="wcelfest-hello" src="/galleries/2016/02/12/wcelfest-hello.png" /></p>
<p>Drawing and note taking of the beginning of the conference including the keynote
speaker - Terry Anderson. It was an excellent keynote. I especially enjoyed him
talking about copyright and open access. There was no mention of Creative 
Commons, but I was actively tweeting with mentions of Creative Commons.</p>

<p>This was the final image of the day. I had grown tired after lunch with 
productivity dropping. Maybe I should of switched. I am use to going to 
conferences and sticking to the same room all week. Maybe they could of 
given the streams topic names?</p>
<p>One of the streams was workshop based which I wasn't interested in. The third
stream looked like they had some interesting stuff. But at the end of the day
it doesn't matter. I enjoyed myself and looking forward to watching the talks
online that I missed. </p>
<p>CYBER is hilarious. lulz when I heard the phase CYBER BULLY. Drinks a shot. 
CYBER was brought up again by the law dean as 
CYBER LAW. He was on a roll and rapped off a bunch of CYBER terms. Kiwicon
would of been proud. Finishes the bottle. </p>

<p>Digital Badge. When I saw the title of this talk I got excited, thinking they
were referring to LED based name tags but instead it was achievement points in 
a education course. </p>

<p>Welsh fella - Glyndwr Jones or JONES did a talk on blended classes. He was 
quite the character and funny. The painting lacks much drawing - only a sad
cat due to parking charges at Waikato University. </p>

<p>This was an interesting talk as the speakers talked about SCRUM development 
being
used for course development. It's normally used in software development and great
to see it's crossing areas. </p>

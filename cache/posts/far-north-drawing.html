<p><html><body><p>It's been a long time since I've submitted traditional media works. Here are a few works from my sketchbook. I haven't been working in my sketchbook as much as I use to, but I always still carry it with me and get it out on occasions. It's even helpful to get it out and show people. Great ice breaker.  <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/DSC_7360d.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2515" alt="DSC_7360d" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/DSC_7360d.jpg" width="4608" height="3072"></a></p>
<p>Basic perspective straight lines. I've been developing these shapes and areas of space in my digital works. These need cleaned up and painted,</p>

<p>This was drawn during my trip in Auckland - at the waterfront. This was a great scene. I enjoy the photos I captured here. They have been helpful in transferring to digital.</p>

<p>The was the second page for the Auckland Waterfront drawing. Here I've gone tonal with the mountains - getting very dark with a heavy pencil. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/DSC_7363left.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2517" alt="DSC_7363left" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/DSC_7363left.jpg" width="4608" height="3072"></a></p>
<p>Left size of the Hamilton drawing. It had been a long time since I'd drawn a double sided</p>

This was drawn in the CBD on the Friday that the GGJ happened. One of my favorite drawings I've done like this. There was a performer on the stage. The sound was crap but some of the covers were ok.</p></body></html></p>

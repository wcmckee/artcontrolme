<p><html><body><p>Spent the morning organizing files and posts. Working on getting a large Borderlands 2 painting post together - it's been a fun side project.</p>
<p>For now though - here's a Lily Allen figure and portrait I painted recently in GIMP. I've drawn this image several times before - it's always interesting going back to these old reference photos and taking a new approach with the work.</p>

Still keeping with the red. I kept this quick and loose - knowing I'd be covering it over with tone and color.<a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/lil.paint_.color_.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1516" title="lil.paint.color" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/lil.paint_.color_-866x1024.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="690"></a>I kept the color very minimal - keeping with just yellow for the dress and blue for the negative space. In other recent works I've used yellow on the skin and red for the clothes - this I decided to keep the clothes grayscale.</p>

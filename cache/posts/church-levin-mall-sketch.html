<p><html><body><p>Pencil Sketches from various locations in Levin. This sketchbook is taking me sometime to get though. I'm only using reference in it - majority are these pencil street drawings.

<p>View from a chair in a local Church. I attended with my Father and Filipino family. The view is the inside corner of the church and windows. Someone stood in the view for sometime so I was able to capture them - certainly helps with the scale. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/1.jpg"></p>
<p></a><a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1215" title="2" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/2-1024x701.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="399"></a></p>
<p>Top left is a painting on the wall. Two figures. Below are curtains and such. I didn't have time to finish this off - the scene changed somewhat when people were packing up, curtains were closed etc. I lost the scene I was drawing and stopped. I guess this is why I enjoy drawing those street scenes. Nothing changes.<a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/2.jpg"></p>
<p></a><a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1216" title="3" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/3-1024x702.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="400"></a></p>
<p>A view of the swimming pool in Levin. Here you can see the hydra slide weaving down.<a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/4.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1217" title="4" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/4-1024x706.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="402"></a></p>
<p>The rights side of the hydro slide view. Mostly trees here. People often tell me they like my tree drawings<a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/4.jpg"></p>
<p></a><a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/5.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1218" title="5" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/5-1024x721.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="411"></a></p>
<p>View of Levin Mall carpark. Some tone added in areas - the pole and mountain. I've drawn this scene many times before, but every time it's very different.<a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/6.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1219" title="6" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/6-1024x703.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="400"></a></p>
<p>On the right tis a sign telling people to drive carefully. Behind this, plants and trees. to the left a stop sign, and part of a mountain continued from previous page.<a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/6.jpg"></p>
<p></a><a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/7.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1220" title="7" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/7-1024x719.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="410"></a>I've really started getting back into tone here, covering the tree on the left, pole and mountains with it. This is a view of sitting on Queen Street.<a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/8.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1221" title="8" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/8-1024x711.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="405"></a></p>
<p>Lights scaling off into the distance with branches of trees behind. Plants and a car at the bottom.<a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/8.jpg"></p>
<p></a><a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/9.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1222" title="9" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/9-1024x701.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="399"></a></p>
<p>Something that isn't Levin. This is a view in Foxton. I went to Foxton with my Father to help a friend cut down trees. This is the view when I was having lunch. I was looking down towards a church.<a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/9.jpg"></p>
<p></a><a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/10.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1223" title="10" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/10-1024x682.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="388"></a></p>
<p>The 2nd half of the Foxton church view. Not so much information in this. Wire stretched across the page.<a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/11.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1224" title="11" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/11-705x1024.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="848"></a></p>
<p>Quick sketch I did at my Grandmas place. I didn't get much artwork done when I was there, spending most of my time playing <a href="http://www.torchlight2game.com/">Torchlight 2 </a></p></body></html></p>

<p><html><body><p>So I'm back in Levin after a trip down south. I have plenty of artwork that I need to upload - this should be happening over the next few days as I scan it in. I'll take this work into gimp and such. Yesterday I worked with acrylic paint, creating landscape paintings from the drawings in my book.</p>

<p>Today I got my tablet back so worked with the collaborate piece started recently with Catherine. I wanted to keep the colors consistent - limiting the amount of colors and working with the color picker.</p></body></html></p>

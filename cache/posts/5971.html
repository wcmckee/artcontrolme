No 3d models or game design was completed.</p>

<p>One of the first drawings completed for the project. For this I used Ruinjam environment artwork as reference.</p>

<p>Again reference inspired from ruinjam site. This included the jams mascot. This character is drawn and morphed into all concept art development. </p>

<p>This was drawn at Fairfield Community Centre. It is created with felt pens. On the right is a character from a book. Skin tone is yellow and background blue. The left is a humanold figure with wings. A child colored it in for me.</p>
<p>Landscape was added with red pen.</p>

<p><html><body><p>It's been a long time since I have updated artcontrol.me with some artwork. I have myself a new tablet so my plan is to work on more art and upload it. For a long time I was updating this site every two or so days. I've slacked off in this and other projects. I have my code which has been going well.</p>
<p>Here is the result from the new tablet and drawing people on RedditGetsDrawn. I am happy with the tablet. Small, but I get the result. I use to own an intous5 medium which was a little too large. The small fits me fine.</p>
<p>Happy I had no problems with the linux drivers also - it was all plug and go. We installed the drivers on the machines at the center - so have it working there.</p>
<p>Enjoy -<a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/may-soulder-line.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-5606" alt="may-soulder-line" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/may-soulder-line-1024x724.png" width="584" height="412"></a> <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/may-faire-line.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-5604" alt="may-faire-line" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/may-faire-line-1024x724.png" width="584" height="412"></a> <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/may-punkfair-line.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-5605" alt="may-punkfair-line" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/may-punkfair-line-1024x724.png" width="584" height="412"></a></p></body></html></p>

<p>For now I'll like to post some older paintings and reflect back on them.<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-674" title="12572" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/12572.png" alt="" width="800" height="533"></p>
<p>This was a quick landscape that I gave to my brother, Luke for Christmas. Looking at the now makes me want to take the colored pencil landscape sketches from my journal into paint. I still have several large boards of wood in Levin that I need to do something with. I think landscapes will be best but certainly need to focus on more detail and concepts with the new paintings.<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-671" title="3745" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/3745.png" alt="" width="800" height="600"> A oil painting that I painted one year ago. My Nana and Grandad on their wedding day. Last time I tried painting portraits it didn't go so well and I ended up painting over with a landscape. When I'm back in Levin everything will be fresh and I'll like to perhaps work on a portrait. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-672" title="3749" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/3749.png" alt="" width="767" height="1024"></p>
<p>Oil painting of my sisiter. Sadly I lost this painting - it just disapeared from my home. I have no idea where it ended up. I hope it is hanging in someones bedroom or lounge as I was quite proud of it and would hate for it to be chucked out. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-673" title="5492" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/5492.png" alt="" width="600" height="800">This was a large portait I worked on of my Nana, explored transparency with building up layers of paint. Currently this painting is sitting in my Mums room as I gave it to her for xmas. I seem to give away all my paintings. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-670" title="12574" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/12574.png" alt="" width="533" height="800"></p>
<p>Getting towards the end of the portait. My pallette and brush that I painted the majority of the painting with is to the right.</p>
<p>More paintings later in the week...</p></body></html></p>

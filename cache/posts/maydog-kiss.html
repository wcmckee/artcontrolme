<p><html><body><p>I've been keeping myself busy with painting people on RedditGetsDrawn. Getting multi paintings done a day is great. For a long time nothing much happened, but it's always great to get back into something that's enjoyable.</p>
<p>In terms of sorting these paintings. I've tried to be better at sorting them into when posting - instead of dumping ten or fifteen into a post, I'll just work with one. This one, has reference, line, grayscale, color tone, and the video. When you think about that it's quite a bit of visual content for one post.</p>
<p>It's the written I struggle with.</p>

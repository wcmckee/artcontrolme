<p><html><body><p>So. I just remembered, It's been a long time since I've updated the blog with some IOGraph works. Recently I havn't been running the program (forget it open it). But I've got it running now... so expect more updates.</p>

<p>Great. Hope you liked these. I've been spending most of my time learning Java. It's been fun and I hope to make some cool programs with it.</p>
<p>Life drawing on Monday.... Double Models... male I believe... but only half a day. In the afternoon we will be showing some work from the term and discussing it. Friday will also be life drawing.... male again. Then it's over for the term.</p>
<p>I'm moving next weekend so won't be attending TLC onsite anymore. I'll try to make it to life drawing in Palmerston</p></body></html></p>

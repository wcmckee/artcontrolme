<p><html><body><p>Didn't end up going into TLC this week. Spent the day working with Blender and looking into game engines. Over the last few weeks I've downloaded several game engines - steam (which I used years ago with Count Strike 1.5), Unreal, Unity3d, and the Cry Engine. I'd like to get some good models/textures and animation done in Blender then look into importing these models into a Engine. But that's jumping ahead too far. For now I want to focus on learning Blender further. Everyday I'm learning something new from it.</p>
<p>I've drawn a little - mostly just sketches with no reference. Done when in bed. I'll upload them in a future post.</p>

Used to make a long walk cycle and move various objects on the side. Need to improve textures and modeling on the overall scene.</p>

I'm work in Blender with two windows systems.</p>

<p>Color sceme ideas. I'm going to keep with my color pencil insprations here - blue for negative areas. Figures and objects will be in reds and yellows. Having a color set will help the scenes flow together.</p>
<p>Finally, here's the video:</p>

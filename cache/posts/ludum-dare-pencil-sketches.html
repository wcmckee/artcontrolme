<p>This is the view from outside my home. I was racing around on my Fathers hand wheel chair and decided to draw the view. A fold up chair would be handy as I'm always having to draw scenes that involve a seat!</p>

<p>I have been using a 2h pencil. It's a wonderful pencil and I could not go back to HB. No smudging, and takes awhile to blunt - shading still works alright with it.</p>
<p>This was drawn well walking down the road - starting sketching ideas for Ludum Dare - but ended up writing down ideas for a podcast I'd like to start with my friend Matt. I don't know if it will go ahead because Matt is very unreliable - I might be better to just organize something myself.</p>

Again - another Ludum Dare logo, this time I sketched the lamppost and large pillar - adding in clouds, figure and tree.</p>

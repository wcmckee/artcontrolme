<p><html><body><p>For the month of November I've been working on a novel. I'm currently at 6,000 words out of a total of 50,000. I don't think I'll make it to 50,000 words but I will make a game out of it. The novel is called Spike InfoSec<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6053" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/pnc-line-1024x724.png" alt="pnc-line" width="788" height="557"></p>
<p>To generate some ideas I started the <a href="http://www.conceptart.org/forums/forumdisplay.php/82-Environment-of-the-Week">Concept Art: Assault on the Ramparts EOW</a> theme. This reminded me straight away of Hellfire Ramparts from World Of Warcraft. I did a quick search for ramparts and got back interested Jewish buildings that could be used for reference. I used these for refereed and completed this.</p>

<p>There is a game jam currently happening called <a href="http://jams.gamejolt.io/pointandclickjam">pointandclickjam</a>. I was inspired by the colour palette so used the palette.</p>

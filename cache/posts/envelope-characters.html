<p><html><body><p>I brought myself a 6 pack of Â colored pencil today. I've felt an urge to get back into drawing. It started when I was hanging out in Andrews office and sketching in his a6 visual diary. I was using a .5mm mechanical pencil. I use to own one and use it regularly, during my time at the Palmerston North School of Design. I also used his colored pens - black, red and blue.</p>
<p>I just remembered I have the originals of the pen works. Here you go:</p>

<p>Robot design I guess. For the background I held 3 pens - creating marks with all 3.</p>

More robot drawings. Pens been fun to use after such a log time with dry media.</p>

<p>Envelope drawing. Exploring poses. With life drawing this term I'll focus on capturing a full character.</p>

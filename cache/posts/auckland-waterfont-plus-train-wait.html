<p><html><body><p>A selection of drawings from my trip to Auckland. I picked the Sketchbook up from Ponsonby and began to fill it with views from around Auckland. Although I picked up two new colored pencils from the French Art Shop as well I didn't end up using it - I've been finding it easier to work with just pencil then adding color at a digital stage. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-848" title="waterfronts" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/waterfronts.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="278"></p>
<p>Auckland waterfront. There were several fisherman out. I sat on a seat and just enjoyed the view. I enjoyed drawing this because it offered me several layers of perspective - something thats important when capturing the scene. No tone either - praticing that line. Once I've taken this into GIMP I'll work on painting<a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/lynn1s.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-844" title="lynn1s" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/lynn1s.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="561"></a>Lynn Mall. During the time I was locked out of the place I was staying in New Lynn I hanged out in the local Lynn Mall. There were several place to sit and draw. This is near the entery of the building. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/trains.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-845" title="trains" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/trains.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="1170"></a>Train. The train takes an hour from New Lynn to Britomart. One hours a long time to work on a drawing, so every time I took the train I was able to get a drawing done. I was happy with the train system in Auckland - it was certainly cheaper than Wellington.<a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/waterfront2s.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-847" title="waterfront2s" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/waterfront2s.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="296"></a></p>
<p>And last another view from the waterfont. This time it's the huge machines they use on the dock. These were lined up in perspective so I struggled somewhat with attempts to capture the scale.</p>
<p>There are more drawings of Auckland that I need to scan and upload. But this will do for now. Enjoy.</p></body></html></p>

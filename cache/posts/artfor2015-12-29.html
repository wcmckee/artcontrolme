<p>I have a Raspberry Pi setup for portable digital painting. It's a 
Raspberry Pi 2b with a 480x320px monitor attached to the GPIO slots. 
It's powered by a battery pack. A Wacom tablet is plugged into the 
USB on the Pi. GIMP is used for the painting and it has the same settings
as I had on the desktop. Now I can paint anywhere, no power needed!
Here's a collection of artwork that I have painted</p>
<p><img alt="bbcafe" src="/galleries/2015/12/29/bbcafe.png" /></p>
<p>Ideas for the Raspberry Pi internet cafe. </p>
<p><img alt="bbloj-color" src="/galleries/2015/12/29/bbloj-color.png" /></p>
<p>Colour logo for BroBeur CyberCafe. I added the line over the colour as 
it looked better than without it. </p>
<p><img alt="bbloj" src="/galleries/2015/12/29/bbloj.png" /></p>
<p>Grayscale BroBeur CyberCafe. Felt it didn't need the line layer.
Sorry, no line image. </p>
<p><img alt="bbpi" src="/galleries/2015/12/29/bbpig.png" /></p>
<p>Signinlca notes. Mostly writing but some drawing on the top left. </p>
<p><img alt="birds" src="/galleries/2015/12/29/birds.png" /></p>
<p>More character sketch ideas.</p>
<p><img alt="birthday" src="/galleries/2015/12/29/birthday.png" /></p>
<p>I went to a bar on the evening of my birthday and painted this there.
I found a corner and stayed in it. It was fun. </p>
<p><img alt="ccbrainwave" src="/galleries/2015/12/29/ccbrainwave.png" /></p>
<p>Creative Commons ideas mixed with NaNoWriMo stuff. </p>
<p><img alt="cyberwar" src="/galleries/2015/12/29/cyberwar.png" /></p>
<p>KiwiCon2015. This was created shortly before the kiwicon conference 
that I attended this year. </p>
<p><img alt="day12no" src="/galleries/2015/12/29/day12no.png" /></p>
<p>This was from Day12 of my NaNoWriMo sketching. During November I wrote
a 50,000 word novel and would carry my Pi with me sketching ideas and 
notes for the book.</p>
<p><img alt="day20no" src="/galleries/2015/12/29/day20no.png" /></p>
<p>Day 20 of NaNoWriMo. This was more of a summery of the book so far. </p>
<p><img alt="dayno" src="/galleries/2015/12/29/dayno.png" /></p>
<p>Writers Den Hamilton mixed with Creative Commons and Open Education 
Resources Sprints 2016. This is an event happening at the end of April
that involves creating education resources.</p>
<p><img alt="dayto" src="/galleries/2015/12/29/dayton.png" /></p>
<p>Another one from early this year. There are several drawings from local
Levin kids. They enjoy having a go with the drawing tablet - usually 
signing their name and creating basic drawings. </p>
<p><img alt="devmob" src="/galleries/2015/12/29/devmob.png" /></p>
<p>This is my spot. Some life drawing of the street - light pole and
building behind it. </p>
<p><img alt="devmobcc" src="/galleries/2015/12/29/devmobcc.png" /></p>
<p>DevMob2015 Creative Commons sketches. Ideas for logos, but got carried
away with characters.</p>
<p><img alt="old" src="/galleries/2015/12/29/gold.png" /></p>
<p>Golden Cloud. This was from early in the year. </p>
<p><img alt="hat-girl-bw" src="/galleries/2015/12/29/hat-girl-bw.png" /></p>
<p>Grayscale painting of a girl with a cool hat. </p>
<p><img alt="hatgirl" src="/galleries/2015/12/29/hatgirl.png" /></p>
<p>Line layer of the girl with a hat. Quite basic really. </p>
<p><img alt="monster" src="/galleries/2015/12/29/monster.png" />
<img alt="robi" src="/galleries/2015/12/29/robin.png" />
<img alt="supermarket" src="/galleries/2015/12/29/supermarket.png" />
<img alt="weirdtwist" src="/galleries/2015/12/29/weirdtwist.png" />
<img alt="wellyno" src="/galleries/2015/12/29/wellyno.png" /></p>
<p>NanoWriMo Final.</p>

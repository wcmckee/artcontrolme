<p><html><body><p>It is Sunday morning. I havn't done anything today. But here's a blog post to get started. The place is tidy. It needs to be tidier though.</p>
<p>Yesterday I tidied. Though I went though some older posts and turned the drawings into digital works.  <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/DSCF5600-Custom1.gif"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-905" title="DSCF5600-Custom1" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/DSCF5600-Custom1.gif" alt="" width="800" height="600"></a>It's been a long time since I've done life drawing. I use to do it often. There are several life drawing classes I'm interested in doing next term - including Rogers week one block class. Wednesday, Thursday, Friday are all 6 hours of life drawing. Dan and Catherine also have a life drawing class during the term - as a weekend class.</p>

<p>The JPG file. Quality is better than GIF but GIF has the advantage of creating animation. It would be nice to create GIF with JPG quality stills.</p>
<p>These drawings were all quick gestural works - breaking the figure down to cubes and basic shapes. I've explored these shapes and developed them further over several months. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-907" title="Gary_Johnson" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Gary_Johnson.gif" alt="" width="800" height="533"></p>
<p>Gary Johnson. This was a warmup work - just wanted to get looser with the tablet. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-908" title="Gary_Johnson" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Gary_Johnson.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533">It's been a long time since I've drawn/painted political figures. I would take my sketchbook into BackBenches and Sketch people.</p></body></html></p>

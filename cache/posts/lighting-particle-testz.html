<p>Normally I have photos to go along with this video footage - I've been quite good at taking a screenshot of my work as I've been using Blender and pasting this into GIMP where I can edit it down and save as a jpeg.</p>
<p>Next time. I need to get more complete scenes done, I've got so much models that I've been messing around with I need to go back and review and enhance.</p>
<p>Life Drawing Friday. This makes me happy.</p>

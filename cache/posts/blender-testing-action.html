<p><html><body><p>I decided to get back into some 3d - taking a break from the digital painting for now. It's been a couple of days since I've painted. I've wanted for awhile to get back into 3d. Working in Blender and Source Filmmaker.</p>
<p>I'll start with Blender. I opened some of my .blend files and retextured the works. The textures used are digital paintings - mostly environments. It's refeshing to see this series of works come alive in a animated world.</p>

I used the character as part of the set - creating two large stationly characters. This helps give the scene more depth - often these blending in with the background. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/blender2.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-927" title="blender2" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/blender2.png" alt="" width="1436" height="834"></a></p>
<p>On the right is a character that moves forward during the sequence. This model has a different texture to everything else - helps with contrast.<a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/blender2.png"></p>

<p>And finally the video of the animation. I'll make another post later highlighting some of my learning in Source Filmmaker.</p>
<p>In the meantime, keep doing what you're doing.</p></body></html></p>

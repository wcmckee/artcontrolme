<p><html><body><p>So no updates for over a week. I've been playing Diablo 3 during the the week. I finished it on normal as a Wizard and partway though Nightmare. I'm not hugely motivated to play it right now - likely a good thing as I can get more important tasks done like artwork. I enjoyed the playthough but Blizzard isn't the same anymore.</p>
<p>I have a new tablet pen and a new place to stay - so it's a fresh start. I havn't done any digital painting since I lost my tablet pen so I was happy to get back into it.</p>
<p>Thought I'd give Photoshop CS5 a blast since I have it on this laptop (though recent updates to GIMP are wonderful).</p>

<p>One of my goals I wanted to do with digital painting this month is look though my life drawings I've done this past term and paint over digitally. I wanted to stick with the colors that I had been using in traditional media, experimenting with techniques and brushes. I'm happy with this work but need to practice further with the digital tablet.</p>

<p>No background. All from imagination.</p>

<p>Background added. Painted this last night.when watching <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0390384/">Primer</a>. I've seen Primer several times before but it's that type of film that I never get sick of.</p>

<p>The EOW of the week over at Conceptart.org is <span><a style="font-size: medium;" href="http://conceptart.org/forums/showthread.php?t=242762">Orbital Refinery</a><span style="font-size: small;">. I want to get into these activitys now that my tablet is </span><span style="font-size: medium; line-height: 26px;">functioning</span><span style="font-size: small;">. I visit the site often for </span>inspiration<span style="font-size: small;">. A google for Refinery gave me some images that I worked from but nothing I'm happy with. I havn't go alot of plans this week so may work on this further. </span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/skell6.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-482" title="skell6" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/skell6.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="409"></a></p>
<p>More ideas for the EOW. Mostly just sketches or doodles. These arn't really going anywhere.</p>
<p><a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/skell4.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-480" title="skell4" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/skell4.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="409"></a></p>
<p>Shapes! I used perspective heavily in my life drawing this last term so want to transfer this to the digital realm.</p>
<p><a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/skell3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-479" title="skell3" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/skell3.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="409"></a></p>
<p>And finally, just a bunch of quick sketches. Again from imagination. This was just used as a exercise to warm up into using the tablet again.</p>
<p>That's all for now. Expect to see further digital works.</p>

<p><html><body><p>Hello. As you can see this site has been used for bbc news spam. This was a python script that i created. 
Basically what the script did was fetch json object with the module requests - and convert it to a dict with the module json.</p>
<p>This was written inside ipython notebook. Each request made choose a random number - between 0 and 13. This decided on which category to choose from - world, uk, tech, education and so on. Something to add to this would be for it not to choose the same option twice, but instead cycle through all 13 choices. </p>
<p>After this the data is then sorted and saved - as a file containing html.Â  This file had the title, summery , and image.</p>
<p>The data wasn't alot, ideally i would like to work with the whole article content - not just the summery. </p>
<p>View the ipython notebook - <a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/wcmckee/bbc2wp/master/jsonBehind.ipynb">bbcnews</a>.</p>
<p>In my next post ill post the script that uploads this file as a blog post</p></body></html></p>

<p><html><body><p>I haven't been drawing people recently. It's all been streetscape works. A combo of nature and manmade structures. I think that's the best way to suggest it.</p>
<p>Here are portraits I have drawn and painted digitally. The reference is photos from REDDITGETSDRAWN. For each piece I used GIMP on my main screen and had the reference open on my smaller screen. For the reference I used my laptop.</p>
<p>I've been playing Borderlands 2.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/Johnny_Jon_John">Johnny_Jon_John</a>  had the request this photo to be painted. I used an orange from a previous painting as a base. Normally I use white, black, dark grey, or a mid grey. Using color for the start background is something new.</p>
<p>From there, line, grey tone, and a lighter yellow for the background area. I did ponder over coloring more of the work in color - maybe the desk, his shirt, the desk chair.  Instead I kept the black and white tonal studies as the main focus point. Opacity was 80%</p>

<p>It's nice to take a break from drawing figures. Going back to it I felt very refreshed. I want to keep these works up.</p>

It was the first I did... so not bad considering the break I've had. The line looks thick on this - in future works I scale the brush down somewhat. Having the line as the top layer also reinforces this. Blues were fun!</p>
<p><a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/reddit.as_.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1360" title="reddit.as" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/reddit.as_-1024x724.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="412"></a>ieatcows requested for his girlfriend to be drawn. This is my result. Again I started with line, tone, then colored background with three different oranges.</p>
<p>All the brushes are custom made by me. I felt there was a real lack of decent flatbrushes so have been focused on creating them, but I'd also be interested in creating more textured brushes - similar to the chalk brush. I'll experiment with tonal ranges within the brushes and see where I go. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/reddit.witch_.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1356" title="reddit.witch" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/reddit.witch_-1024x667.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="380"></a>Reddit user <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/kawaiian">http://www.reddit.com/user/kawaiian</a> Kawaiian had the request to turn this into something for Halloween.</p>
<p>This is my result. One of my final works for the day. I had done many and was growing tired by this point. I'd like to think the image had a witch feel about it. Especially the hair.</p>

This is one of my favorite works. I especially enjoyed drawing the clothes. For the background I wanted to use my visual library and construct a scene. Alot of this inspration currently is the works I've been drawing around Levin.</p>

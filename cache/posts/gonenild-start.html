<p><html><body><p>I use a script to pull data from one subreddit to another. This helps me choose and organize my works easier. 
I was explaning the script to my Brother and telling him what i want to do  next with it.</p>
<p>One change i can do is change what subreddit it pulls data from. For awhile this was set to chosse a random subreddit that the user subscribed to. I've gone back and changed it to a specif subreddit - ive been focusing on RedditGetsDrawn and GoneMild. It's bee fun painting people on GoneMild - the photos tend to be full bodies so plently of info to capture. </p>
<p>There is also a bonus line drawing of Olaf from Frozen. </p>
<p>Enjoy -</p>

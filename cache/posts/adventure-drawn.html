<p><html><body><p>Back in the library today to write a blog post. I'll see how I feel after and hopefully get some code done also.</p>
<p>Here are two more digital paintings I completed before I left Hamilton:</p>
<p><a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/raniff-line.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6120" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/raniff-line-1024x724.png" alt="raniff-line" width="788" height="557"></a></p>
<p>Raniff line layer. In the reference the girl is holding a piece of paper that has a drawing of her on it.Â  Instead of a drawing of her on the line layer I added the <em>GetsDrawn </em>title and a landscape.</p>
<p><a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/raniff-bw.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6119" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/raniff-bw-1024x724.png" alt="raniff-bw" width="788" height="557"></a></p>
<p>Grayscale tonal layer. Since the reference was a blonde I used light on the hair and medium on the skin. Landmass in the distance is dark, with a medium sky and light water.</p>
<p><a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/uroboros74-bw.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6121" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/uroboros74-bw-1024x724.png" alt="uroboros74-bw" width="788" height="557"></a></p>
<p>Grayscale tonal Uroborus74 layer. Sorry I didn't include the line layer. It's sitting on my desktop computer in Hamilton.</p>
<p>For this the request was to be drawn like a character from the television show <em>Adventure Time</em>.<a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/uroboros74-color.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6122" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/uroboros74-color-1024x724.png" alt="uroboros74-color" width="788" height="557"></a></p>
<p>Colour layer. Yellow is used for the skin and red for the hair. Blue for the shirt and sky. The landmass - a dark yellow and red. Aqua for the water.</p>

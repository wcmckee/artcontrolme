<p><html><body><p>Here's a quick digital painting I worked on tonight. I've finally got CamStudio working correctly - I want to record games and art. I own a decent microphone, it just needs a stand. Will pick one up sometime. The microphone on my old white headset is decent for now. For now there is no sound in the videos. Maybe put on some <a href="http://www.pandora.com/">Pandora</a>?</p>
<p>It had been a long time I had just painted in GIMP without tracing over an image. Helpful to start creating original paintings in GIMP using my drawings as a reference rather than just a tracing tool.</p>
<p>Enjoy</p>

<p>New colors, new approach. The reference I used for this was a sketch in Wellington - on Cuba Street. Instead of tracing over I used the sketch as visual reference. My tones are certainly stronger - It has a more painty feel!</p>
<p>In terms of colors - love how the green and yellow blend together beautiful. I will keep with these colors and work on a series.Â <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/cuba1.jpg"></p>

I made this after to display the colors I used. I ended up mixing some new colors to work with as well. These may be used in a later painting.</p>

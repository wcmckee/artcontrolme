<p><html><body><p>I had a request today to upload some art. I have a new sketchbook that I have started to fill. Always buying new sketchbooks. So many half finished.
Here's a pencil sketch from Cuba Street, Wellington. H pencil.</p>

<p>I had drawn this scene before. I remember because of the hook icon on the building.</p>
<p>Cuba Street is one of my favorite spots to draw in Wellington. I'm able to sit, focus and produce some great drawings.</p>
<p>These last few months my drawing has been minimal. Around Levin I don't draw like I use to. Whenever I visit Wellington - my drawing sparks.</p>
<p>I still feel sick and cold though.</p></body></html></p>

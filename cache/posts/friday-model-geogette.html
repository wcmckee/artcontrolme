<p><html><body><p>Friday. Experimenting Drawing. Georgette modeled. I hadn’t drawn her since sometime last year. It certainly wasn’t the most progressive life drawing class… but it was fun to draw Georgette.</p>
<p>I worked easel – brown paper – long strips. These strips fit on the board easily without folding areas over the board. I’ll keep working with this shape and explore where it leads…</p>

<p>15 min pose if I remember correctly.  Could be longer. foreshortening is exciting. It’s nothing to be scared of. Nothing is impossible to draw. Especially with life drawing – all the information is in front of you. I used an old watercolor pencil for the negative space. These are a lower quality then the excellent Derwent Colorsoft I use. Worth using them up this year as I don’t want to take them overseas when I leave.</p>

<p>Chunck of graphite – 8b. I’ve had this since 2010 so it’s getting small. It’s a favorite for warmups. This isn’t a warmup – but I’m frustrated and not enjoying it. Why do some days life drawing works and others, fail.</p>

<p>Similar to the earlier drawing. This has structure. foreshortening is a major element. I was able to create huge thighs compares to smaller arms in the background. Certainly creates depth within the artwork.</p>

<p>A portrait. I like to keep up my portrait skills so when I have a life model I try to get a portrait done.</p>

<p>I like this. It might be my favorite of the day. It’s a shame I didn’t get more time to work on it. I would enjoy more longer standing poses but they are hard for the model to hold. Longer poses tend to be sitting or lying.<a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/DSCF5421-Custom.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-131" title="DSCF5421 (Custom)" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/DSCF5421-Custom.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="562"></a></p>
<p>Bunch of quick studies. Looking at shapes. In several I’ve added tone. This boosts them out of the page. Action and movement is easily captured with this method of drawing.<a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/DSCF5430-Custom.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-132" title="DSCF5430 (Custom)" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/DSCF5430-Custom.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="562"></a></p>
<p>Another page of studies. Plus a portrait thrown in there! One to note is in the middle (to the right of the white)  - the elbow is pointing out and hand wrapped around hip. This was a solid attempt of capturing the foreshorting with only line.</p>

<p>And the final gestural page. By the end of the day I was tired and left early. Hanged out in Marcs class. It was nice to have a break from life drawing as I was reaching 14 hours this week. You can over do it and it’s important to not burn out.</p>
<p>Dan will have a model on Monday.Rumor has it – clothed model. I’m not sure if I will go or not. I’ll see how I’m feeling. Marc Hill on Thursday which I’m looking forward to! OILS</p></body></html></p>

<p>Two woman chatting in the corner. Captured then quickly without worry for detail. Focus was taken for the perspective and scale of the scene. I like how I've worked my laptop into the painting and painted the painting.</p>

<p>Grayscale tone. Again like the previous painting I've been working with a range of tones scatted about the work. Sometime I pick the tone, but other times I'm just pick a random number on the slider. It's important to have a range though.</p>

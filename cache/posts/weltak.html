<p><html><body><p>Good morning. I got back to Levin yesterday - my Fathers place. One of the first things I did was open GIMP on the desktop computer and produce a digital painting - and record it. I didn't record the color stage, but managed to record all up to grayscale tone.</p>
<p>Here's the painting:</p>

<p>The far left reference is a sketch book I did in Wellington at the railway station. I've taken this into GIMP previously and was happy with the result. I thought it was about time to have another go. On the right I added a drawing of a cafe in Takaka, and above that trees in Christchurch. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/wel-train-ref.jpg"></p>
<p></a><a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/wel-train-line.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2125" alt="wel-train-line" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/wel-train-line-1024x515.jpg" width="625" height="314"></a></p>
<p>Line. I modified my pressure settings in GIMP to get more variety in my line - you can see this in the figure sculpture in the middle - very thin line. I'm happy with this line as it gave me enough information to develop good tone over it. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/wel-train-ref.jpg"></p>
<p></a><a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/wel-train-bw.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2126" alt="wel-train-bw" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/wel-train-bw-1024x515.jpg" width="625" height="314"></a></p>
<p>Grayscale tone. I made up the tone as I went by just applying a range of tones over the page. For more important areas or foreground I used dark and light for less important areas. Darks for figures always seems to work best. Now, color. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/wel-train-ref.jpg"></p>
<p></a><a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/wel-train-col.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2127" alt="wel-train-col" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/wel-train-col-1024x515.jpg" width="625" height="314"></a></p>
<p>I had lots of fun with the color on this. Mixed and layered. The colors are my normal ones, but I also included a different tone of the red that I use for the line</p>

<p>And the video, sorry for missing color. Better than nothing!</p></body></html></p>

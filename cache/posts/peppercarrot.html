<p>I went on a search for artists that licence their work under a
free creative commons licence. Through the site DeviantArt 
(which needs a CC licence search filter) I found 
<a href="http://peppercarrot.com">Pepper and Carrot</a>. Not only is
it a very high quality professional web comic, it is licensed 
under the super awesome CC BY. </p>
<p>I used the web comic as reference and redrew it in my own style,
along with a few extra doodles thrown in there.</p>
<p>Enjoy - </p>

<p>Creative Commons icons redrawn with excellent round circles.</p>

<p>I have been reading the NeverEndingStory. I had seen the movie.
The book is excellent. These sketches were created when I was 
reading the book. Almost finished it so need to decide on the 
next book - considering a Terry Pratchet Discworld novel that
contains witches since that will work well with the recent
Pepper and Carrot drawings. </p>

<p>The first Pepper and Carrot sketch. One of the most appealing 
elements about the web comic is the focus on environment - 
something I am passionate about. </p>
<p>I had to switch some things around - such as the mailbox and
didn't include the birds. I've also gone my own way with 
clouds and trees behind the house. </p>
<p><img alt="c-dstarrrtt" src="/galleries/2016/03/08/pnc-dstarrrtt.png" /></p>
<p>The first sketch of the characters. Didn't include any background,
only the characters and the book that Pepper is drawing in. 
The text is written in caps. </p>
<p><img alt="c-dragonstooth" src="/galleries/2016/03/08/pnc-dragonstooth.png" /></p>
<p>Including the characters and elements of the room. I love the 
high angle!</p>
<p><img alt="c-cold" src="/galleries/2016/03/08/pnc-cold.png" /></p>
<p>Sketch of other two witches. Fire is smoking. </p>

<p>Pepper rushing off. I liked the blur movement effects in the
original. Mine has this with the foot being redrawn. I don't
erase, only draw.</p>
<p><img alt="c-fly" src="/galleries/2016/03/08/pnc-fly.png" /></p>
<p>Pepper and Carrot on the broomstick. Had fun drawing the 
pillars. Should of left space in the sky for the text which
I ended up cramming in. </p>
<p><img alt="c-drago" src="/galleries/2016/03/08/pnc-dragon.png" /></p>
<p>I didn't end up finishing redrawing the whole comic.
There was nothing in the rest that really made me want to draw
it. Had lots of fun with this though. </p>
<p>For NanoWriMo this year I might write a novel based on Pepper 
and Carrot.</p>
<p><img alt="c" src="/galleries/2016/03/08/pnc.png" /></p>
<p>Started drawing elements from another Pepper and Carrot comic -
where the two are on a beach. I liked the monster and the change
in enviorments. </p>
<p><img alt="teatme" src="/galleries/2016/03/08/teatme.png" /></p>
<p>I redrew a comic from <a href="http://mooselakecartoons.com">mooselakecartoons</a>
Just something simple. </p>
<p><img alt="waitabl" src="/galleries/2016/03/08/waitabl.png" /></p>
<p>Drew this at Waikato Uni. Mostly environment from imagination 
but a observational drawing on the top right. </p>

<p>I missed out on attending LCA2016 but was lucky enough to
make it to OWASP - a one day security conference. 
Like all the recent conferences I have attended I took in my Raspberry 
Pi and painted. The Pi was of interest,
getting questions when morning tea arrived.</p>
<p>The drawings from the day:</p>
<p><img alt="owasp16-bus" src="/galleries/2016/02/05/owasp16-bus.png" /></p>
<p>Leaving Hamilton early on the bus the majority of this was drawn on the 
trip to Auckland. It was a long bus trip - 3 hours. The traffic was bad 
but I arrived only ten minutes late. </p>
<p>Sitting up the back I noticed lots of people using Slack, which I was 
kind of surprised about. The first speaker - Dan Wallis talked about 
Credit Card Fraud. I drew him with a landscape in the background. </p>
<p><img alt="owasp16-crypto" src="/galleries/2016/02/05/owasp16-crypto.png" /></p>
<p>Crypto talk. This is interesting for me as I have played around with 
hashing passwords with Python a little. Something I would like to 
explore further. Not allot of drawing here - mostly sketching of words.
Though I have drawn the company logo - bug. </p>
<p><img alt="owasp16-foo" src="/galleries/2016/02/05/owasp16-foo.png" /></p>
<p>FooBlog. Exploring vulnerabilities in a blog. OAUTH2 
<img alt="owasp16-kaltura" src="/galleries/2016/02/05/owasp16-kaltura.png" /></p>
<p>A talk on Kaltura (an open source video platform). This was drawn in the
afternoon and I started to get too tired to do much at this point. </p>
<p><img alt="owasp16-morni" src="/galleries/2016/02/05/owasp16-morning.png" /></p>
<p>Full page of drawings. The mornings I always get lots drawn as I'm fresh.
Laura Bell had a bunch of images on her slides that I was able to draw. 
I like it when speakers have images on the slides as it gives me something
to draw. The only other stuff I can draw is the speaker or things around
the room (AV equipment etc). </p>
<p><img alt="owasp16-plane" src="/galleries/2016/02/05/owasp16-plane.png" /></p>
<p>The final drawing of the day. I give up.</p>
<p><img alt="owasp16-webrtc" src="/galleries/2016/02/05/owasp16-webrtc.png" /></p>
<p>A talk on WebRTC. Speaker was very entertaining. Draw a portrait of 
him and took a bunch of notes.</p>
<p>Till next year OWASP...</p>

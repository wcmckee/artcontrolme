<p><html><body><p>Awake early this morning - 5am. Wanted to get straight into the digital painting. I first checked Reddit SketchDaily - Free Draw Friday. Fantastic - can just do a street scene.</p>

<p>I mashed together three drawings I did in Levin. This system of mashing drawings together is working out well - it's allowing me to cover more ground and use the drawings that I may not have used otherwise.<a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/lvnmash.line_.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1474" title="lvnmash.line" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/lvnmash.line_-1024x341.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="194"></a></p>
<p>The inking. I choose to use a brown over the black. It gives a more natural look over cartoonish. That's what I want. Having the lines in the first place is wrong, but it's been helpful for me to develop my work into more detail. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/lvnmash.line_.jpg"></p>
<p></a><a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/lvnmash.bw_.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1475" title="lvnmash.bw" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/lvnmash.bw_-1024x341.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="194"></a>Gray-scale tone added. I used three brushes - two custom made flat brushes for the objects/sky and a vegetation texture brush for the vegetation (leafs). I should have added dark and texture to the sky. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/lvnmash.col_.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1476" title="lvnmash.col" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/lvnmash.col_-1024x341.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="194"></a>And color added. Same colors as the previous works like this.Not much happening in the foreground - focused on the background further by using a dark red in the clock tower in order to push it back. My favorite areas are the left and the clock tower.</p>

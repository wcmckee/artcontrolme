<p><html><body><p>Last week I did a marathon of painting people from <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/redditgetsdrawn">RedditGetsDrawn</a>. The majority of the time the photos posted are only portraits, but I find fill figures to be more fun to draw. <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">. </span></p>

<p>Line. Added in the characters first before the background. With the background I made up a scene based on my recent works, water, buildings, towers, and the sort.</p>

<p>Tone. All the block areas in the background is basically covered with tone. Maybe I should of focused on keep with the background shapes more in the tone version... keep it more similar to the line version. I wanted to get alot of these works finished so was rather rushed for time. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/kids-reddit-bw.jpg"></p>

I don't like how the towers in the background are not sharp. Happy with the floor and characters.</p></body></html></p>

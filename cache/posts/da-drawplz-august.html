<p><html><body><p>I jumped on DeviantArt tonight and worked though a few of the posts on DrawPlz with drawing requests. It was relaxing, and certainly captured me into the zone. These are quick, gestural, and nothing special.</p>
<p>Mostly they are 'draw my OP' which is easy, because I get reference and I don't need to think, just paint.</p>

<p>The reference was much more zoomed in, I went for a further zoom. I like the curves that I captured in the hair (dat black!). The shirt looks like it could use more work</p>

Post was 'Draw a person and/or a animal. I started with the character and added the horse character as a toy of some sort for the character. Background was a quick sketch of blues - but continued to explore the idea of vertical pillars.Â <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/2381714_2084458.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-772" title="2381714_2084458" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/2381714_2084458.png" alt="" width="450" height="340"></a>Draw a eye. Very quick. I started one before this but hit back on my tablet by mistake. I really should disable the button when I'm doing painting on DA - it's frustrating to lose the work - even if it's only 30 seconds.</p>

I looked though the artists gallery and choose a image to copy. I added the vertical pillars and the scale of the character is different.</p>

<p>Final 'draw my op'. This was was more detailed then I drew it. I wish the DAMuro was better, it really is a rubbish piece of drawing software, being not much better than MS Paint. Larger sizes would be nice - 600-800 etc would be wonderful. There is also a lack of decent painting brushes, copy/paste, and thick to thin pressure sensitive. GIMP is best!</p></body></html></p>

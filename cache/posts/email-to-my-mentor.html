<p><html><body><p>I got a new mentor. Here’s the email I sent her today explaining my plan and such for the year. You can read it too….</p>
<p>Hi Sophie.</p>
<p>My cellphone is currently at my Mothers home in Levin… I will have it later back late next week. Best contact is via email. I check daily.  I’m useless with a cellphone.</p>
<p>I’m really happy to be back at TLC… Roberts block this week.</p>
<p>Over the holidays I focused on digital painting. Normally I draw and paint from a life model (pencil/color pencil/crayon/acrylic).</p>
<p>This term I’m doing Life drawing on Monday with Dan and painting with Marc on Thursday. I life paint every 2nd Friday. On days I don’t go into TLC I’ve planned several exercises:</p>
<p></p><div></p>
<ul>
    <li>Sketchbook. I’ve used these for years and will continue doing so. Pencil, Colored Pencil, pen, watercolor. I like to get outside and draw from life – people, buildings, trees, anything I find interesting.</li>
    <li>Website. Working on a new design. Continue with regular posting. Get some guest post/collaboration happening. Launch a programming blog in March (so need to work on the design for this)</li>
    <li>Reddit SketchDaily. I’ve been doing this for the past month and a half and will keep it up</li>
    <li>Environment of the Week – ConceptArt.org - I’ve never entered artwork – the standard is high. I plan to start working on the themes and upload paintings for it.</li>
    <li>Video. Continue with recording of digital painting. Expand to oil painting. Commentary.</li>
    <li>Programming. Currently working with Python, and learning C++. I see programming going hand to hand with art.</li>
</ul>

<p>So that’s my plan for the year. Knowing myself, bound to change and evolve.</p>

<div>In terms of my artwork and getting it to you – my blog posts are the best stop – lets you see what I’m thinking behind the artwork. You can subscribe to my blog via email or RSS reader. I also upload to TLC Workroom but I don’t upload everything. I can also email you artwork if that’s best for you.</div>

<div>I’ve setup a digital worklog with Google Docs. Since you arn’t at TLC campus (my last mentor Lee was) a digital worklog will be easiest.</div>

<div>I’ll keep this regularly updated.</div>

<div></div>

<div>I think that’s everything for now. I’ll keep you updated.</div>

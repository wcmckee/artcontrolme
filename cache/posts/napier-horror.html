<p><html><body><p>So it's been sometime since I've done digital painting. I did plenty of it last year and felt I improved greatly. This year it's my goal to produce even more paintings. With already almost a week into the new year I thought I'd better get onto it.</p>
<p>Sorted though my sketch book drawings I took them into GIMP and began a paint over process. Here's what I've done so far:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2083" alt="nap-park- bw" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/nap-park-bw1-784x1024.jpg" width="625" height="816">This was one of my favorite drawings I did during my time in Napier. I had attempted to digital it in the past but was not in the mood. Having a holiday from the digital painting felt good, I felt refreshed.</p>
<p>Sadly I wasn't able to use my favorite custom brushes in GIMP as they are only on my desktop, and I only have my laptop with me in Auckland. Once I'm home I'll transfer the brushes onto the desktop.</p>
<p>My favorite area of this painting is the right side, with the large tree trunk I managed to create a interested texture (working 80% opacity). And the pole to the right of it worked out well. I created textures by using a range of difference marks - for example to create the hedge I used a dot action. This is something I want to explore further this year. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/PORTRAITS.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2081" alt="PORTRAITS" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/PORTRAITS-669x1024.jpg" width="625" height="956"></a>I received a new camera for Xmas. Decided to upload the photos I take to <a href="http://freshfigure.com/art/">FreshFigure.com/art: Stock Photography</a>. These photos are licences under creative commons so feel free to do what you like with them, but I'd love to hear about it.</p>
<p>I used a several of the photos I had taken to do some figure and portrait studies. It had been sometime since I had worked like this and I think it's always important to keep up with studies of people. The process is the same as always - red line, followed by gray scale tone. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/portrait2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2084" alt="portrait2" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/portrait2-724x1024.jpg" width="625" height="883"></a>Here I added the figure and portrait to the Napier painted scene. I played around somewhat with scale and composition  I'l keep working on it. I also did a quick color paint over - red for the skin, yellow clothes, and blue for the background. For my Mums portrait I worked different - adding the yellow into the mouth area. Adds somewhat of a horror effect - something out of Hannibal maybe?</p>
<p>That's all for now. I now have no excuse to work on a digital painting everyday and upload it - I have plenty of reference photos and drawings to work from.</p>
<p>Almost forgot - I've recorded these paintings but have problems with Movie Maker on my laptop so unable to upload to youtube. Once I'm home  (later this week) I'll get them uploaded. I think it's better that I just get paintings done even if I don't get everything recorded than not paint.</p>
<p>Stay cool honey bun.</p></body></html></p>

<p>An excellent theme. Very open and wide with an interesting keyword - millions.</p>
<p>I was at my Mothers place when the them announced. I had a team (2 other programmers) but had problems commuacting with them so I gave up for the afternoon and just focused on helping Mother.</p>
<p>I did talk to my sister about the theme. My first thought was bugs and beetle.</p>
<p>Once I got home I started on digital painting of weird bugs.</p>
<p>Next step is 3d.</p>

<p>Ideas for the bugs theme. Lots of bugs<a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/BBJ08-LINE-BUG.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6000" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/BBJ08-LINE-BUG-1024x768.png" alt="BBJ08-LINE-BUG" width="788" height="591"></a>Large bug in the middle is the main. I love the headpiece attached to their head. I watched<em> Bobs BurgersÂ </em>with my sister and drew several characters. These will likely not be turned into 3d models, rather focus on the more bug like characters.</p>

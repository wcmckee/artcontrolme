<p><html><body><p>I woke early this morning. 6:30. I switched on a episode of The Walking Dead and started painting. I mucked around a little but managed to get a painting finished. I've spent the rest of the day cleaning and getting washing done. It's still not 100% but cleaner that what it was.</p>
<p>Here's the painting I did this morning -</p>
<p><a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/lvn-win-ref1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2245" alt="lvn-win-ref" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/lvn-win-ref1-1024x506.jpg" width="625" height="308"></a> I grabbed random drawings from my Levin drawings folder with the intent of adding water elements into the image. All three reference images offer interesting contrast. The right side is lacking a little with drawings, but I can just fill it in with lines. There is enough here to work with.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2248" alt="lvn-win-line" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/lvn-win-line1-1024x506.jpg" width="625" height="308">Ok Line done. As you can see I've changed the image somewhat, adding water behind the foreground area. Drifts into the horizon. Scatted around the edge are vehicles  trees, and buildings. I want my paintings to have a more 3d feel to them, create scenes that could then be modeled out - not just use this painting as a background - but create from within. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/lvn-win-TONE.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2246" alt="lvn-win-TONE" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/lvn-win-TONE-1024x506.jpg" width="625" height="308"></a>And tone. People are lacking on this work. It's been quite usual lately for me to include them. I used my standard flat brush but also mixed it up with a watercolor brush.something different. The tree in the middle is strange and out of place. It wasn't this dominant in the line drawings but I brought it out in the tone. Doesn't work.</p>
<p><a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/lvn-win-COLOR.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2247" alt="lvn-win-COLOR" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/lvn-win-COLOR-1024x506.jpg" width="625" height="308"></a>And color. I've really gone off using that red. I even tried darkening it to see if it would help - decided to not go with it though. At least I got the yellow in - two versions of it - the light (which i always use) and the dark (which I need to use more). Blue in the background could do with another shade, the opacity was high (90%) when I painted the sky - doesn't help. 80% is good.</p>

<p><html><body><p>Here's some more digital works. This time I used reference from RedditGetsDrawn.

<p>Portrait photo reference. I usually go for photos that have more of the body but this one was interesting with the tape covering her mouth. The background was plain, with only the vertical tiles. I added in quick flicks. I wanted to work different here - created a map top down view rather than a perspective looking over the ocean to the hills in the distance.</p>

<p>The tone changed the map idea with more of a focus on perspective  - the normal way I do these scenes. I've used range of brushes. Normally I stick with the one brush in the whole painting but adding more adds texture and variety to the piece.</p>

<p>Color. Went with a orange for the skin. Since I've been using a range of tones with the color I feel I can explore other colors without having problems of the colors not working together - like in washes. Using the range of tones allows for clarity and flow within the color - and spreads throughout the whole painting.</p>

<p>This was a great reference of these two people. When I was little my uncle would give me piggy back rides.  Extremely large scale for the figure sitting on the others shoulder.</p>

<p>Grayscale tone. Much of the work is flattened out - the ground area doesn't contain the texture that the line version had. Minimal focus on the face details - leaving out eyes/nose/mouth.</p>

<p>A range of saturation was used in the figure. Previously I had only worked with adjusting values. I love the brush for the leaves. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2765" alt="TODAY.LINE" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/TODAY.LINE_.png" width="3600" height="1200"></p>
<p>Figure on the left. I used a photo I took in Wellington for the environment  I often just use my imagination. Working from reference will be helpful. Especially using my own photographs.</p>

<p>Mixing up the colors with a blue for the figure. Pink was used in the building, not sure how I feel about it - doesn't fit the flow of the painting. Maybe a nice brown would have worked better. Fun times with the green, covering the majority of the painting. The hills and sky in the distance are painted blue.</p></body></html></p>

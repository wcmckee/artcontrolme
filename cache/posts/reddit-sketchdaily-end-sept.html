<p><html><body><p>Hello. It's been sometime since I have done the Reddit SketchDaily challanges. End of last year I was doing them regularly. But I got sick it. Lately I've tried to get back into it, just for something more.<a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/amanda.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1204" title="amanda" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/amanda-1024x768.png" alt="" width="584" height="438"></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/SketchDaily/comments/10dzw9/september_24th_i_get_by_with_a_little_help_from/">September 24th - I Get By With a Little Help From My Friends</a>. I choose to draw my friend Amanda. I met Amanda during my time at TLC. I had used these colors before in other paintings. It was nice to work from a photo reference - something different to the usual drawing reference.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/SketchDaily/comments/10g7aj/september_25th_organicification/">September 25th - Organic-ification</a>. The idea behind this was to create a organic vechal. I started with a basic car design and colored with these tree inspired colors. I could of gone further and tried to make the car more tree like.</p>

I took a recent drawing I did of a family friend - Hannah into gimp. Since the theme was gradients I used a light and dark of each color. This is my favorite of the set.</p>

<p>Here's a video of me painting two of these. Sadly the video of Amandas painting became corrupt.</p></body></html></p>

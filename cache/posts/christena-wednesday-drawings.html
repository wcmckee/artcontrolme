<p>No more Roberts for the week - Instead I'm in Christenas. She created a block class as there were a bunch of foundation that weren't told about signing up for classes and there was an overflow of students.</p>
<p>Christina is lovely and allowed me (and Angelique) to join into the class for the rest of the week.</p>
<p>I wanted to carry  on with ideas that I had been developing since Friday. This meant continuing with oil pastel. Focus was on capturing light and dark. The lighting was brilliant - dark room and spotlight on the model. This made looking for the lights and darks easy....</p>

<p>Slowing down to one minute poses - chance to add tone into areas. It wasn't much but happy with some of these works.<a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/DSCF5543-Custom.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-226" title="DSCF5543 (Custom)" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/DSCF5543-Custom-e1332313172849.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="800"></a>Christina liked this arm so I thought I better take a photo of it. I didn't get a whole lot of feedback from her - but I enjoyed her attitude and enthusiasm to the class. She is certainly a life drawing 'tutor' and helps people greatly with their work. A balance with expressionism and studies I found.<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-223" title="DSCF5548 (Custom)" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/DSCF5548-Custom.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600">Oil Pastel. Similar colors and ideas that I've been working with these last several days. The light today is partially good - strong contrasts between the light and dark allows me to capture it easily.</p>

<p>Something a bit different. There was a skeleton model setup in class and for this pose the model and the skeleton held the same pose. I started with the skeleton and drew in James over top. Working the skeleton and model together is something I'd like to explore further. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/DSCF5537-Custom.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-229" title="DSCF5537 (Custom)" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/DSCF5537-Custom.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600"></a></p>
<p>The drawing on the right is working well for me. The black helps the contrast well. I've applied a white over the black to help with blending. Progressing from earier sessions I feel.</p>
<p>I've done 21 hours of life drawing since Friday and have another 12 to go. Out with a blast - it makes me happy!</body></html></p>

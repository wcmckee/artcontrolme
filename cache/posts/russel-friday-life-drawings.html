<p><html><body><p>Friday went well. Russel was the model again. I wasn't happy with the works I drew on Monday - just wasn't in a good space. Friday was much better!</p>
<p>My surface to work on was large. I turned a fold up table on its side and used it as a backing board! I had pre-cut most of the paper so the size isn't larger that I'm working on - though I was able to fit more figures along the page. Wish I had taken photos! I'm planning on doing it again (maybe even on Monday if there is room) so will be able to upload photos of the setup. People were impressed!</p>
<p>Here's the drawings from the day. All completed with 4b pencil and colored pencils:</p>

<p>Gestural, warm ups. I've been exploring turning the figure into shapes in order to capture the complete model quickly. Enjoyable. The pencil has been nice to use - I spent so much time with colored pencil, the detail and feel of pencil is different... strange really.</p>

<p>This was a final pose of the day. I had asked if we could do a series of poses. Each pose was two minutes - and I'd get the model to spin around on the spot - holding the same pose. This allows me to capture the front, side and back. Russel misunderstood this and choose a new 'action' pose each spin. I really love this one though - maybe I'll have to ask other models to redo this pose. Bringing a gun (toy of course) to class could work well.<a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSCF5614-Custom1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-397" title="DSCF5614 (Custom)" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSCF5614-Custom1-e1336281198912.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="800"></a>The word for this pose was dance. Again - I could see this working well for a spinning pose. All it really needs is better lighting so I can capture the lights and darks quickly. Flat lighting is hard.  <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSCF5613-Custom1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-396" title="DSCF5613 (Custom)" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSCF5613-Custom1.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600"></a></p>
<p>With this Russel held the same pose in each turn. Can totally tell that he's turning around. I'll take this into Blender/3d and model it out. Wish it had color! <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSCF5610-Custom1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-394" title="DSCF5610 (Custom)" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSCF5610-Custom1.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600"></a></p>
<p>Gestural works. Lots of experimenting with scale. I think I spent an hour working on the same paper so build up a large amount of figures on the same page. I'd like to work with more of those two min poses - collecting a large amount of model rotation poses. All on the same page would be impressive. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSCF5609-Custom1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-393" title="DSCF5609 (Custom)" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSCF5609-Custom1-e1336281261935.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="800"></a></p>
<p>Color. Different. Using green as a line <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSCF5608-Custom1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-392" title="DSCF5608 (Custom)" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSCF5608-Custom1.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600"></a></p>
<p>Longer poses. I wasn't happy with this pose - back poses like this always give me very little to work with. I had a go with my white charcoal - something I havn't used since the beginning of last term<a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSCF5607-Custom1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-391" title="DSCF5607 (Custom)" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSCF5607-Custom1-e1336281294216.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="800"></a></p>
<p>Another longer pose. I'm not sure if this is working - it seems broken and incomplete.<a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSCF5605-Custom1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-390" title="DSCF5605 (Custom)" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSCF5605-Custom1-e1336281309391.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="800"></a>Another turning model pose. Again I'll take this into Blender and model it out. I had time to capture some light in the pose but would like to have a better lighting setup so I didn't struggle so much. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSCF5604-Custom1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-389" title="DSCF5604 (Custom)" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSCF5604-Custom1-e1336281327356.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="800"></a></p>
<p>I quite like how this came out. Exploring perspective with both feet - especially the one that's close! Dan talked about the negative spare - mentioning how some of the lines are working and some seem off. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSCF5603-Custom1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-388" title="DSCF5603 (Custom)" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSCF5603-Custom1-e1336281348304.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600"></a></p>
<p>This is tidyer. I like tidy. Even though my bedroom is a total mess. I like clarity in my life drawing. The left foot is working well - got positive comments from Megan and Dan about this. The middle portrait is my favorite portrait of the day. Dan mentioned - It's very Russel. The shading technique - straight lines is new for me and I'll explore it further. An exercise Dan got some of the class to do was straight lines. I was impressed by several works in the class. Including Megans - who was using promarkers to draw. I've used promarkers once for life drawing and struggled. It could be good for me to give them ago again - pencil dominates so much of my work. It was good I used oil pastel for Christenas block class at the end of</p>

<p>An last - the final of gestural works. These are mostly done with my right hand (I'm normally left handed). These other hand works are working better then normal. So simple but creates a effective line. Maybe I'll work like this further. COLOR. RAWR,</p></body></html></p>

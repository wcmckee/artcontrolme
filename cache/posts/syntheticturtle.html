<p>Portrait I painted of Reddit user - syntheticturtle.</p>
<p>This was from redditgetsdrawn.</p>
<p>I've started working on another game - this time for the Peace, Love and Jam. It starts next weekend but I'm going to just work on it during the weekend since I don't have time during the week.</p>
<p>I've been setting up an easel at Fairfield Community Centre to get the after-school kids to do some art. It's great - got a minute of six year olds, up to twelve. I'll make another post in the future with some of these images (been taking photos on my phone).</p>
<p>Enjoy this digital painting, three layer, line, gray, and color.</p>

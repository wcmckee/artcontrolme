<p><html><body><p>A digital painting that isn't referenced from RedditGetsDrawn. I like the band<em> Vampire Weekend</em>, they have recently released their third album recently titled <em>Modern Vampires Of The City</em>. It's certainly on par or better than the previous two albums. My favorite track is <em>Step.</em></p>
<p>In celebration of the album I decided to paint the band. Mixed it up a little by adding typography. Enjoy -</p>

<p>Normally the very awesome #67151b is used for line, but for this black. I guess it doesn't really matter what color I produce the line layer, as long as it's clear against the background. I'll stick with #67151b I think....</p>

<p>No tone in the face causes the flatness. I mentioned this in my previous post. A mid/dare gray would help the image pop. Mixture of chalk and flattish brushes. You can see the areas that the chalk brush has been used due to the roundness. What's your thoughts on flat vs round brushes?</p>

<p>Happy with the background on this color later. Darkest red for the type, with a mid and light used for the land. The brush creates interesting effects of leaning areas. This is a result of cutting in with the blue that was used in the sky. A light blue surrounds the title with a darker tone on the outside. For the ground #c8d991 was used with a darker value used as a second color to add tone to the area.The same red that was used in title has been used for the band members hair. Yellow for the skin. I explored using red for lips but it wasn't working so covered it up with the yellow. CTRL-Z is for losers.</p>
<p>Finally enjoy the video -</p>

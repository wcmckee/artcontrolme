<p><html><body><p>Todays theme for Reddit SketchDaily is: A study in Grays.
Interesting theme! Gray!</p>
<p>I used <a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=gray&amp;l=commderiv&amp;s=int" target="_blank">Flickr</a>for reference images. Normally I use Deviantart for stock images but DA stock artists often get cranky at using their photos on websites that isn’t DA. I hate DeviantArt with a passion. I started going back on there again but realised again quickly just how shit it is. Conceptart.org is better.</p>
<p>The reference I found on flickr:</p>

<p>My sister has a gray cat. She’s a sweetheart and never would hiss, delicate. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/poenaru/1304953088/" target="_blank">Find it on Flickr here.</p>

<p>Ok, now a painting. I started with a quick line sketch. I’ve enjoyed using these lines recently. A small change.</p></body></html></p>

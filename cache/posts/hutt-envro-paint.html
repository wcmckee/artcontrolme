<p><html><body><p>Took a break from Unity today and worked on just digital painting. I also left the house and went for a trip to Upper Hutt. The view overlooking the Hutt was quite stunning. I got a friend to take some photos so I have some new reference for digital painting.</p>

<p>These are all much the same as my recent digital works. Keeping with the single layer and 60% to 80% opacity. conceptart.org has been a big inspiration... I'm inspired to better my artwork because of the works I see on the site. Practice, practice, practice!</p>

<p>Using the same colors and ideas throughout these paintings helps create a series and harmony. Feng Zhu suggests working on multiply paintings... so I do!</p>

<p>My least favorite of the bunch. Might be the angle I don't like. But something about this I don't like. It's just not working.</p>
<p>Here's a lapse of these digital paintings. No sound sorry.</p>

<p>Some of the process of the paintings is missing, but the video shows the switching between paintings. I'm going to produce more of these videos - I'm just having trouble with file sizes and types. I'm using the software CamRecorder but it saves as .avi - making it useless to take into Windows Movie Editor (crappy I know, but it works for me). I'd like it if CamRecorder was able to save it as a compressed movie file that I was able to edit in Windows Movie maker. If anyone knows how to do this - please let me know.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I'll be heading into Wellington for two days - I've been in the Hutt. I'm looking forward to heading back to Levin. The Hutt has been fun... but so cold.</p>
<p>I'll try to get in some digital painting tomorrow... and maybe some sketches in my sketchbook I have taken some photos of recent sketchbook work and just need to upload to the blog. I havn't put up any traditial drawing works for ages so it's about time. I do like working digital though - it's fast, cheap, and not messy (not that working colored pencils is messy@)</p>

<p><html><body><p>I'm currently in the South Island. I left my laptop and Wacom tablet behind - I needed a break from them. Too long I spent working on the laptop, not getting much done. When I return it will be fresh.</p>
<p>I do have a A4 visual diary that I am planning to fill up on my trip. So far I've mostly just drawn 3d figures from imagination. On Saturday me and my Uncle Donald attended a drawing class. Portraits was the focus. I spent two hours drawing portraits of my Uncle. The tutor - Kare had exercises for the class to do. Many of these exercise I had done before - such as blind contour drawings - and drawing with your opposite hand. One I hadn't explored before was creating using the media to create planes of the face - darker for deep and lighter for forward. This was interesting - rather then looking at the light and dark look for where areas come forward. This is something from the class I'll take away and experiment further.</p>

I had drawn Donald several times and wanted to include someone else in the drawing. The woman beside Donald is a regular for the drawing class. I decided to include her into the drawing. Here she is drawing  the person oposite her. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/DSC01732copy.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-661" title="DSC01732copy" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/DSC01732copy-767x1024.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="779"></a></p>
<p>The exercise for this was looking at the planes - darker for closer and lighter for further. It was a exercise I hadn't explored before so great to give it a go. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/DSC01735copy.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-663" title="DSC01735copy" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/DSC01735copy-767x1024.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="779"></a></p>
<p>This was spose to be one continious line. I tried my best to keep the line going but may have forgotten at times and taken my pencil off the page slightly. People commented in the nose. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/DSC01736copy.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-659" title="DSC01736copy" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/DSC01736copy-767x1024.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="779"></a></p>
<p>Blind contor drawing. Tried to add some colored pencil in there as well! Instead of just doing the portrait I wanted to include areas of the shirt as well. </p>

I know Dan is a big fan of this - keeping some areas loose and going in tighter in other areas.</p>
<p>The town I'm staying is Takaka. The hills are inspiring, tomorrow I'll get out and the landscapes in the area. No point being stuck inside with Freeview and dialup Internet.</p>
<p>On Wednesday there is a life drawing class - 15 dollars for three hours. I haven't had the chance to do any life drawing for a LONG time. 15 is quite expensive compared to the cheap 5 dollars at Vincents but what can I do!</p></body></html></p>

<p>Here's a digital painting I did from imagination. I had a kid observing me and giving me in instructions on what to add.</p>

<p>I started with the figure, then added the floor. For the background I went with large circles as hills. I was told to add a cave into the mountains, this is visible on the left. There is a figure rising from the hill.</p>

Much of the detailed areas in the line version are removed. Added though, is tone and shape. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/marns-color-Large.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2715" alt="marns-color (Large)" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/marns-color-Large.png" width="1920" height="640"></a></p>
<p>Color. I explained how I use a restricted amount of colors - three here, and that I use a range of tones (3 usually) of the colors. This isn't finished, yellow could be added.</p></body></html></p>

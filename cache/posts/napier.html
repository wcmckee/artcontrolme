<p><html><body><p>Back from Napier. Visited my Granddad. I had my laptop with me but no internet - I noticed several shops in the CBD that offered free WIFI. I didn't worry - instead spending the time offline on my laptop and watching CI, Sky Sports (cricket),One News and the horse racing with Granddad.</p>
<p>I got out each day and drew. Here are the street works from around Napier:</p>
<p><a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/draw-hello2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1668" alt="draw-hello2" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/draw-hello2-744x1024.jpg" width="584" height="803"></a></p>
<p>Square. I sat here several times and drew. This was a favorite piece of mine. I'm looking forward to taking it into GIMP and painting over it. With the line I attempted to create a range of marks in order to show the texture.</p>

<p>Waterfront. Sitting on a bench and looking South. It was beautiful weather - especially in the evening. This is the left side of the page... I continued it onto the second. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1672" alt="nap-e" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/nap-e-1024x744.jpg" width="584" height="424"></p>
<p>Plant in the foreground. I captured someone walking but - mostly to give proportion to the image. Thinking about it now - I really should of checked on life drawing classes. Oh well, I enjoyed the drawing on the streets. Plenty of people on the street that I was able to capture.</p>
<p><a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/napiior-a.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1674" alt="napiior-a" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/napiior-a-1024x677.jpg" width="584" height="386"></a>This was on Friday night. I sat near a car park and drew the church and plants across the road. They had a water fountain that I especially enjoyed drawing.</p>
<p><a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/napior-b.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1675" alt="napior-b" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/napior-b-1024x744.jpg" width="584" height="424"></a>Second page of the church drawing. Less detail in this one - just quick<a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/sb-lvnpol.m.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1679" alt="sb-lvnpol.m" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/sb-lvnpol.m-1024x744.jpg" width="584" height="424"></a></p>
<p>Before the trip. This was drawn in Levin.</p>
<p><a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/napior-c.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1676" alt="napior-c" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/napior-c-744x1024.jpg" width="584" height="803"></a></p>
<p>This was a night drawing. I sat on a street that reminded me greatly of Cuba Street. Looking out towards where I walk to my Grandfathers home. It's quite the wak, but I got out at least once a day.</p>
<p><a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/nap-draw-water.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1677" alt="nap-draw-water" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/nap-draw-water-744x1024.jpg" width="584" height="803">W</a>ater front drawing. I started with Gouache (work I'll post in a future post). People liked to come to the waterfront, many sitting and eating fish and chips. In this piece two figures sit and watch the hills<a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/nap-draw-landscape2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1678" alt="nap-draw-landscape2" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/nap-draw-landscape2-1024x744.jpg" width="584" height="424"></a></p>
<p>Yet another waterfront drawing. One major difference I noticed with painting was the problem with catching small details - rather impressions of the area. I'll try to work with goauche more but /i do enjoy the life drawing to digital painting process.</p>
<p>I look forward taking these works into GIIMP.</p>
<p>More drawings and start posting paintings later.</p></body></html></p>

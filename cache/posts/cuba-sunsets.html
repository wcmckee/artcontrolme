<p><html><body><p>I've been wanting to complete some digital paintings for days. I've been busy with other art related activities. I have so much work to sort though. Create a portfolio book and get it printed. So far it contains pencil portraits from 2008.</p>
<p>Here's two paintings I did last night. Both in GIMP. The first - RedditGetsDrawn</p>

<p>Brother and Sister portrait. Close to being a full body shot. Cut off at the knees! I did two drawings of these two. The first is in the center - cropped down. It's been awhile since I've used the Wacom Tablet (4 days I believe) so felt somewhat rusty. The facial area is especially messy. I could have been more gently. Oh well. Onto the tone. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/janeplace-tone.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4717" alt="janeplace-tone" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/janeplace-tone.png" width="2000" height="667"></a></p>
<p>And tone added. Range of brushes used. Messed up with the layers and painted over a line layer. Didn't realize this till later. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4721" alt="Untitled2 (Large)" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Untitled2-Large.png" width="1920" height="640"></p>
<p>Line layer. For this drawings I didn't use RedditGetsDrawn instead a photo I had taken on Cuba Street.  The figure in this drawing was a child that was running. He jumped in front of the camera yelling, 'Take a photo of me'.<a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Untitled2-tone.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4719" alt="Untitled2-tone" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Untitled2-tone.png" width="2000" height="667"></a>Tone added. Somewhat simple and minimal feel. Layered up the figure with a range of tones.</p>

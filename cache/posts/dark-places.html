<p><html><body><p>I'm getting a new drawing tablet soon, I thought I would get it this week but when Mightyape tried to charge my credit card it declined as I realised they had an outdated one. I'm going to have to ring up Kiwibank, change my address and order a new card. It's a bit frustrating... I've been really careful with my wallet over these last two years. So weird to lose it all of a sudden.<a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Untitled2.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-549" title="Untitled2" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Untitled2-1024x679.png" alt="" width="584" height="387"></a></p>
<p>So my old tablet is with my sister now - so no digital painting. I may get it back off her till my new one arrives. Annoying! In the meantime I've been working in Blender - created a new model and animated it. It's the most strange creature animation I've done so far... quite digging it though. Working on creating longer animations - rendering out between 100 and 200 frames per animation instead of 50ish. This should lead to more finished and polished looking word.</p>

<p>I've also been taking several of my digital paintings into Blender and using them as background. These create something truly unique within Blender.</p>

<p>I'll keep working with Blender and animating these scenes... though I would love to develop this work further into a game engine.</p>

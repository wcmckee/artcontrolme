<p>Her Feet People. It was a rainy day. Her shoes and socks were wet. She took them off. </p>
<p>She has excellent ideas regarding art activities and came up with the idea of tracing her feet.</p>
<p>This tracing of her feet was developed further into characters.</p>
<p>The character on the left is Dolly and on the right is meÂ  - William. The characters are holding hands :)</p>
<p>The clothing and colors are the same as what we were wearing. Awesome obsovational traits.</p>

<p><html><body><p>So I just did a dump of photos. I would of written more but my browser was going extremely slow and I just wanted to get something published.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm still at my Mothers home, and this is a painting I did before I left to Hamilton: <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/mask-line.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2347" alt="mask-line" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/mask-line.jpg" width="7087" height="3508">I</a>n the reference the guy in the mask was standing in front of a farm like setting. I always go for reference on RedditGets drawn that has an interesting background, it just gives a setting to put the characters into. If there is no background I like to make something up.</p>
<p></p><p style="text-align: left;">I loved drawing the gas mask. It reminds me of something out of Fallout or Metro. Anyway, Onto the tone. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/mask-bw.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2348" alt="mask-bw" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/mask-bw.jpg" width="7087" height="3508"></a> Tone. Again, making the character darker than the background. Helps in the contrast between the two subjects. For the background I did a  scribble effect for the objects in the very   back<a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/mask-color.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2349" alt="mask-color" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/mask-color.jpg" width="7087" height="3508"></a></p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Interesting to see color after spending so much time lately working without it. It's done me good though, and I'm excited for the next time I start using color again in my works. I think my tones have really improved by giving this focused look into tonal studies.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Lastly, something I haven't been doing when away - a video: <iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/sbNjFz-_vNI" height="480" width="853" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>

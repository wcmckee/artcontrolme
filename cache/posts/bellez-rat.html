<p><html><body><p>Here's a digital painting Â I did today of Bellez. I promised her a painting months ago of her rats. It's not the most dominating image of her Rat, it's something.
It's been a long time since I've create a video for my digital painting - 3months! I used my old tablet, so looking forward to getting my new one back. I've returned it to MightyApe so it shouldn't be too far away.</p>
<p>Until then, I'll keep painting, because it makes me happy.</p>

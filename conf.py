# If you want to use Nikola with a non-supported language you have to provide

# If a specific post is not translated to a language, then the version
# in the default language will be shown instead.

# What is the default language?

# If you have a page something.rst, then something.pl.rst will be considered
# its Polish translation.

# this pattern is also used for metadata:
#     something.meta -> something.pl.meta

# (eg. 'Europe/Zurich')

# While nikola can select a sensible locale for each language,
# sometimes explicit control can come handy.
# In this file we express locales in the string form that
# python's locales will accept in your OS, by example
# "en_US.utf8" in unix-like OS, "English_United States" in Windows.
# LOCALES = dict mapping language --> explicit locale for the languages
# in TRANSLATIONS. You can ommit one or more keys.
# LOCALE_FALLBACK = locale to use when an explicit locale is unavailable
# LOCALE_DEFAULT = locale to use for languages not mentioned in LOCALES; if
# not set the default Nikola mapping is used.

# POSTS and PAGES contains (wildcard, destination, template) tuples.
#
# The wildcard is used to generate a list of reSt source files
# (whatever/thing.txt).
#
# That fragment could have an associated metadata file (whatever/thing.meta),
# and optionally translated files (example for spanish, with code "es"):
#     whatever/thing.es.txt and whatever/thing.es.meta
#
#     This assumes you use the default TRANSLATIONS_PATTERN.
#
# From those files, a set of HTML fragment files will be generated:
# cache/whatever/thing.html (and maybe cache/whatever/thing.html.es)
#
# These files are combinated with the template to produce rendered
# pages, which will be placed at
# output / TRANSLATIONS[lang] / destination / pagename.html
#
# where "pagename" is the "slug" specified in the metadata file.
#
# The difference between POSTS and PAGES is that POSTS are added
# to feeds and are considered part of a blog, while PAGES are
# just independent HTML pages.

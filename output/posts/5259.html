<p>Over the weekend I worked on a game for Asylum Jam.</p>
<p>I had signed up to a list of people that were looking for groups. A group emailed me asking for a 2d Artist and bonus if they had 3d modeling skills. I added them to Skype and joined the group.</p>
<p>Their idea was based on this video:</p>
<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/W_TUu1GpVZM" height="360" width="640" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe>

<p>They sent me some 3d models to textures. These were machine like for the crushing machine. I had a go at texturing these. Problem I ran into was the fact that my tablet is broken and only responds if I draw with the eraser end. This works fine in GIMP where I bind it to paint - in Blender however I can't seem to switch this to paint - only erase. This meant I had to export the texture pattern to GIMP to paint. I don't usually worry so much about detailing textures - often just creating an abstract pattern for them. Animating this texture also gives good effects. I suggested the pattern animation for the group but it was never followed though.</p>
<p>The group was using Unity3d for the project. Sadly I still only have a Linux system so was unable to help with the game design - something that I usually really enjoy.</p>
<p>The group asked me to create ghost like shapes for the characters. It was their project and they were telling me how to paint. This seemed fine at the time but really I should have just painting my usual style as it was distracted and unproductive. I sent them many paintings to use in the project but only one of my paintings was used in the project. This was somewhat disappointing after the project was finished and handed in as they had used stock images to fill the space. This is why it's best that I lead groups - similar to my setup with Melonie for Suburb Nightmare</p>

<html><body><p>The Raspberry Pi digital painting setup is stable. I have been able to walk and draw with it - though not as steady as sitting down or standing sill. Majority of the art is from imagination but some are landmarks and GetsDrawn.com



Enjoy - <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/nychar-line.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6258" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/nychar-line-1024x724.png" alt="nychar-line" width="788" height="557"></a>



 



Mixture of monster robotic characters and portraits from GetsDrawn. I've added their username near the portrait.

It's been a long time since artcontrol.me: artwork of William Mckee has had a new logo. Using the Raspberry Pi and my Wacom tablet I traced over an old logo - to give it new life. This is the line layer. It's a little rough and quick, but the logo will cleanup on the grayscale tonal and color layers. I would never use a line layer as a logo.

Grayscale tonal. The R in artcontrol and the smaller text is a mess.

Colour. Using Green on figure.

I will end with this. Red line layer. Characters for the gamejam Adventure Jam. It goes for two weeks. I'm not sure how much I'll get done - so far I've only produced paintings. The name of my game is <em>Hunt For Naples Yellow. </em>The name is inspired from the film <em>The Hunt For Red October </em>and named after my digital painting/python dev pi machine - naplesyellow.



Naming all servers after colours.



Crayons.

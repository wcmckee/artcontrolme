Tribute. Planning to model this suit in blender. It seems easy enough and can use it as a costume for a character. I have a basic few characters that I'm happy with (still need to tweck mesh on many. More detail is whats needed more. Buildings. Streets. I need a world created. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/spin.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-406" title="spin" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/spin.jpg" alt="" width="742" height="767"></a>



Planes with the drawings UV mapped onto them. I need to learn more advance texturing techniques. Need to watch more youtube

Here's what I modeled (and textured) out of the life drawings. Again - no head was modeled. I think it works well. It certainly gives it a different look. Lighting in this cubes with colored material. I'd like to digitally paint the colors then use that as lighting. More interesting then using normal spot lights.



Here is a bunch of rendered material:

The most recent works. I'm looking forward to experiemtning with these more - opening up older blender files and editing them again with the skills I have learnt.

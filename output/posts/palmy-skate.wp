<html><body><p>I have been changing a few brush settings in GIMP to get different effects. Most notable I enabled opacity pressure sensitive. In the past I've always had this pressure sensitive set to just size - so the harder I press the larger the line. Turning both on really execrates the effect - the smaller line seems further away since the opacity is lower etc...


I have also started using full screen mode in GIMP which removes the top bar - the result - the painting taking over my whole screen  Great.



Anyway, I had to ink this work 3 times - my first three attempts resulted in my video file being over 2 gigs. I use CamStudio which has a bug in so that if a file hits over 2gig the file corrupts. I'm normally really excellent at not letting files hit this 2gig mark - but this morning it went wrong twice. CamStudio has a option to auto stop after a certain amount of time - I've got this set to 1700 - but it didn't stop for me!



On to the painting:

The reference is a combo of 3 drawings in total. The first is a drawing I did in Palmerston North sitting in the square. This is one of the rare perspective drawings I have done - the road fades off into the distance. I mashed this up with another two drawings of the Levin Skate Park. This is technically one drawing spread over two pages - but i scan them in separably. Opacity is dropped to 50% in order to seen drawings underneath.

Holley saw me do this inking and liked it. The opacity changes certainly helps the line feel more flow. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/ca.paldk8_.tone_.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1551" title="ca.paldk8.tone" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/ca.paldk8_.tone_-1024x341.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="194"></a>Tone added, Small detailed areas ignored and focused on large shapes. My favorite areas are the cars, Added vegetation to the foreground in order to help with the depth. <a style="font-style: normal; line-height: 24px; text-decoration: underline;" href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/ca.paldk8_.col_.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1552" style="border-color: #bbbbbb; background-color: #eeeeee;" title="ca.paldk8.col" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/ca.paldk8_.col_-1024x341.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="194"></a>Color. I had lots of fun with this. Mixed colors on the palate - something I don't normally do. Added a figure to the right - felt it needed something in the foreground. Certainty not my favorite work as I feel it's still too fuzzy. What if I used the smudge tool?

<html><body><p>Here's a couple of images I've been working with. Trying to get something done for the EOW. I'm not partially happy with them. So I moved onto working with more of a straight street scene. Which I'm happy with. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ca0lvn.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1263" title="ca0lvn" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ca0lvn-1024x640.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="365"></a>


I used a drawing I did in Levin as reference on my other monitor as I painted this. The brush I used is a custom brush I made myself. It has a very flat brush feel to it. Love it! I'm going to keep working on making brushes out of areas. Maybe release a brush pack? <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ca0lvn.jpg">

Here I scaled down the previous painting and worked on adding more content to the painting. I feel my paintings often lack information and want to work on adding more. This is a good start



I'll add the other paintings... but I'm not happy with them...<a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ca0lvn2.jpg">

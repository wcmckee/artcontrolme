<html><body><p>RedditGetsDrawn is a helpful resource. Usually William works digitally from the site, creating color or grayscale paintings.  Sometimes the tablet will be dropped and replaced with pencil and pad. 
	In his previous pad (the a5 landscape, black bound, white pages) he produced a series of works from reference found on redditgetsdrawn. 
	The following images are in the new sketchbook, which is a similar size to the previous. The paper quality is far higher. The off white look is appealing. 
	Full figures are more fun to draw than portraits for William. The idea of creating a  character in a world works better with a full figure over a portrait. 	
	HB pencil was used. William swears by his clutch pencil. It doesn't go far from his side. If it does, he's looking for it. He's likely stressed and worried that he will have to buy another.

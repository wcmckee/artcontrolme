<html><body><p>Today has been much better than yesterday. I woke up feeling good. Even after a long walk yesterday I felt crap. Anyway, I slept in today which helped, waking up at 10am. Bruce was heading into the center at Noon so I got ready and headed in with him. I had my tablet and laptop with me. Finding material was hard, so I decided to paint a musician I hadn't painted before - Lana Del Ray. Much the same process as my previous color digital painting - line, black and white tonal, and finally color. It's great that I'm setup at the center with the digital painting!

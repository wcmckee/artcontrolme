In total this is three drawings. The top left is a view from Levin North School, below is the same image rotated 180 degrees. This is scaled down as well. I wanted to attempt a reflection look. On the right - a scene I drew in Wellington. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/ca.lvnskl.line_.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1540" title="ca.lvnskl.line" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/ca.lvnskl.line_-1024x341.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="194"></a>Line. It's been a few days since I've painted something I've liked. At this moment. I like this.


<a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/ca.lvnskl.tone_.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1541" title="ca.lvnskl.tone" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/ca.lvnskl.tone_-1024x341.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="194"></a>Tone added. Again some detail is lost through the painting process  Certain areas blend into one another - especially the bush and sky. This can be fixed when color is added, My favorite area is the traffic light on the center right.<a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/ca.lvnskl.col_.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1543" title="ca.lvnskl.col" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/ca.lvnskl.col_-1024x341.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="194"></a>Color. With color I was able to define certain areas that were getting mixed up with the gray scale tone. Blue for the sky, yellow for bush (and reflections) and red for objects (buildings/advertising box). This is very loose, I'd like it to be tighter. I'm not sure how I feel about these colors as well - I'm using mulitipy. I think I prefer the works that I paint over the gray scale normal with low opacity

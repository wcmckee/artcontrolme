<html><body><p>I've got a better setup in my room now for working on the computer. My energy has been low for a long time, this is why I haven't been updating the site. I've been focusing mostly on making games.


I never got a replacement Tablet for the Wacom Intous 5. Instead, I've kept with the small one. It's alright, and does the trick but doesn't allow me to paint all day as a get a sore hand.



Here's a zombie painting I did from RedditGetsDrawn. I would post the reference but I checked back on the listing and it seems it's been deleted! Must always save the reference images.



Anyway, here you go:

Zombies are fun to draw. This one had somewhat of an Asian look. I rearranged the scene somewhat - sending the guy on the left towards the back and bringing the zombie forward. Moon/landscape in distance/water, and a fence to separate the zombie and guy.

Tone. Merged the guy into the background somewhat. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/JULY-ZOMBIE-COLOR-Large.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-5184" alt="JULY-ZOMBIE-COLOR (Large)" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/JULY-ZOMBIE-COLOR-Large-1024x512.png" width="625" height="312"></a>Pushed forward the guy out of the background with using the skin tones (yellow and red), these are the same as the skin tones I used on the zombie. For the water I used green, and landscape/sky blue. You can see all the tones of colors/gray-scale I used on the left.



I have a few pencil drawings that I need to either photograph with my phone and upload or buy a new SD card for camera.



I hope you enjoyed that digital painting and I'll be sure to upload more in future - it's important I keep slugging away with these digital painting :D

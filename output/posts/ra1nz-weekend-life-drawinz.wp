<html><body><p>Dan had a weekend class - Figurative Expressions. He mentioned he liked it call it this rather then drawing as people are free to explore other medians - like paint and sculpture. Knowing Dan - he won't mind if you paint during a experimental drawing.

<div><span>We had two models. On the Saturday - a male, and Sunday - a female. Both Days were a success, partially the works on Saturday and final works on Sunday. Longer poses didn't go well surprising. </span><a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/120514-153407.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-425" title="120514-153407" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/120514-153407.jpg" alt="" width="768" height="1024"></a><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-426" style="color: #333333; font-style: normal; line-height: 24px; margin-top: 0.4em;" title="120514-153353" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/120514-153353.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768"></div>

<div><span>Action poses. From Saturday. I constructed the model out of shapes. I don't like measuring these shapes, they are always estimates.  I wanted to practice creating perspective around the model - this is why I used simple lines to contract an environment.</span></div>

<div></div>

<div><span>These are more developed - color! I stuck with yellow and blue for the negative space. On the Saturday the focus was on line so it was hard to capture tones - so I've just given it a flat color. Again - using lines in the negative space to construct an environment for the figures.</span><img src="file:///C:/Users/Will/AppData/Local/Temp/enhtmlclip/120512-170010.jpg" alt=""></div>

<div><span>The drawing on the bottom right is working - torso, upper legs, and knees captured. I've been practicing the 'S' shape - in order to create a fluid line - I focus so much on straight lines - it's important that I can produce other types of line.</span></div>

<div>These were some of the final drawings of the weekend - and some of my favorites. Dan was impressed by the scale change of the models/ I wanted to line up a character\.<img src="file:///C:/Users/Will/AppData/Local/Temp/enhtmlclip/120514-152403.jpg" alt=""></div>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-423" title="120514-152403" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/120514-152403.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768">

<div></div>

<div style="color: #333333; font-style: normal; line-height: 24px;"></div>

<div></div>

<div><span>And the final two from that sheet. As you can see I'm working landscape apposed to horizontal. It's a habit I've picked up with all the brown paper drawings with life drawing. I enjoy it.</span><img src="file:///C:/Users/Will/AppData/Local/Temp/enhtmlclip/120514-152612.jpg" alt=""></div>

<div style="color: #333333; font-style: normal; line-height: 24px;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-424" style="color: #333333; font-style: normal; line-height: 24px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial;" title="120514-152612" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/120514-152612.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768"></div>

<div></div>

<div>More pratice of the 's' mark. I partically enjoy those legs that I colored around with blue, Forms really working. I'll like to develop this further.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Need to create better lines.<a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/120514-153015.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-429" title="120514-153015" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/120514-153015.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768"></a></div>

<div><span>I dared to use some <span>promarkers</span>. They just don't do it for me.</span></div>

<div></div>

<div><a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/120514-152951.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-430" title="120514-152951" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/120514-152951.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768"></a></div>

<div></div>

<div>This created an interesting perspective - leaning backwards while lying down. The few shapes I used created a basic idea of the shape of the model.</div>

<div></div>

<div><span><span>okk</span>, <span>im</span> tired so this will do. overall a wonderful weekend life drawing. I've been rather useless on the computer lately - i think i need a break. but any computer work I do will be - Blender. Still more to learn. Need to render more material, expand particle systems further. </span></div>

<div><span><span>gamedev</span>. I had a blast with Hammer tonight. It's <span>ok</span>, but really what I need to do is import my blender material into Hammer. I've had a go with Unity3d, importing a .blend file. Though, no success it's something I could use <span>Youtube</span> and find tutorials. </span></div>

<div><span>programming. I made a basic <span>roguelike</span> last week with python, I'd like to explore this further. Especially look at ideas that would allow me to create a 3d <span>Roguelike</span>. </span></div>

<div>Maybe writting more. That could always be helpful.</div>

<div>I hope you like the life drawing. More will be happening this Friday. I'm not sure who the model will be. But it will be a female! I'll be using pencil and colored pencils again - lifting off where Sunday left me.</div>

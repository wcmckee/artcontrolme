<html><body><p>I had a request today to upload some art. I have a new sketchbook that I have started to fill. Always buying new sketchbooks. So many half finished.
Here's a pencil sketch from Cuba Street, Wellington. H pencil.

I had drawn this scene before. I remember because of the hook icon on the building.

Cuba Street is one of my favorite spots to draw in Wellington. I'm able to sit, focus and produce some great drawings.

These last few months my drawing has been minimal. Around Levin I don't draw like I use to. Whenever I visit Wellington - my drawing sparks.

I still feel sick and cold though.</p></body></html>

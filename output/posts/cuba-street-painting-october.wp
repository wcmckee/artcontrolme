<html><body><p>It's been several days since my last post. I've been on a trip to visit my Grandma. I got a bit of drawing done there - still need to scan the works in though. I was spose to scan it at Mums this afternoon - but forgot. I'll try to get it done tomorrow so I can get some drawings uploaded.


Here's a recent digital painting I did in GIMP of Cuba Street. Complete with video of the painting and narration. Enjoy.

Grayscale painting of the scene. Reference was a drawing I did on Cuba Street. It's modified somewhat - added areas. This took 20 minutes.Â <a style="font-style: normal; line-height: 24px; text-decoration: underline;" href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/concept-monday.jpg">

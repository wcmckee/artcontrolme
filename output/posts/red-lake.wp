<html><body><p>Currently sitting in Levin library. Thought I'd better make a post since it's been a few days. I've been more focused on Python code recently than painting. I feel I'm making some large strides forward with Python.


Anyway here's a landscape painting I did from imagination. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/ca-imagine.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1654" title="ca-imagine" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/ca-imagine-1024x682.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="388"></a>



 



I sniped the line and when straight to tone.. This is quite different to how I usually work - focusing on similar techniques as Feng Zhu - creating chaos and attempting to create a scene out of it. This is something I need to practice, maybe using some of my sketchbook works as inspiration but not painting over them.



I used a range of crushes - a custom flat brush that I often use in my works and also chalk - another brush I commonly use. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/ca-imagine.jpg">

Color. The colors used - blue for the sky, yellow for the pillars and ground. I've also go a red along the bottom - this could be some sort of river or lake.



That will do, back to python code. Before I go here's the video: <iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Hz174uL-qBw" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315"></iframe></p></body></html>

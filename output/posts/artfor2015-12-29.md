I have a Raspberry Pi setup for portable digital painting. It's a 
Raspberry Pi 2b with a 480x320px monitor attached to the GPIO slots. 
It's powered by a battery pack. A Wacom tablet is plugged into the 
USB on the Pi. GIMP is used for the painting and it has the same settings
as I had on the desktop. Now I can paint anywhere, no power needed!
Here's a collection of artwork that I have painted

![bbcafe](/galleries/2015/12/29/bbcafe.png)

Ideas for the Raspberry Pi internet cafe. 

![bbloj-color](/galleries/2015/12/29/bbloj-color.png)

Colour logo for BroBeur CyberCafe. I added the line over the colour as 
it looked better than without it. 

![bbloj](/galleries/2015/12/29/bbloj.png)

Grayscale BroBeur CyberCafe. Felt it didn't need the line layer.
Sorry, no line image. 

![bbpi](/galleries/2015/12/29/bbpig.png)

Signinlca notes. Mostly writing but some drawing on the top left. 

![birds](/galleries/2015/12/29/birds.png)

More character sketch ideas.

![birthday](/galleries/2015/12/29/birthday.png)

I went to a bar on the evening of my birthday and painted this there.
I found a corner and stayed in it. It was fun.

Creative Commons ideas mixed with NaNoWriMo stuff. 

![cyberwar](/galleries/2015/12/29/cyberwar.png)

KiwiCon2015. This was created shortly before the kiwicon conference 
that I attended this year. 

![day12no](/galleries/2015/12/29/day12no.png)

This was from Day12 of my NaNoWriMo sketching. During November I wrote
a 50,000 word novel and would carry my Pi with me sketching ideas and 
notes for the book.

![day20no](/galleries/2015/12/29/day20no.png)

Day 20 of NaNoWriMo. This was more of a summery of the book so far. 

![dayno](/galleries/2015/12/29/dayno.png)

Writers Den Hamilton mixed with Creative Commons and Open Education 
Resources Sprints 2016. This is an event happening at the end of April
that involves creating education resources.

![dayto](/galleries/2015/12/29/dayton.png)

Another one from early this year. There are several drawings from local
Levin kids. They enjoy having a go with the drawing tablet - usually 
signing their name and creating basic drawings. 

![devmob](/galleries/2015/12/29/devmob.png)

This is my spot. Some life drawing of the street - light pole and
building behind it. 

![devmobcc](/galleries/2015/12/29/devmobcc.png)

DevMob2015 Creative Commons sketches. Ideas for logos, but got carried
away with characters.

![old](/galleries/2015/12/29/gold.png)

Golden Cloud. This was from early in the year. 

![hat-girl-bw](/galleries/2015/12/29/hat-girl-bw.png)

Grayscale painting of a girl with a cool hat. 

![hatgirl](/galleries/2015/12/29/hatgirl.png)

Line layer of the girl with a hat. Quite basic really. 

![monster](/galleries/2015/12/29/monster.png)
![robi](/galleries/2015/12/29/robin.png)
![supermarket](/galleries/2015/12/29/supermarket.png)
![weirdtwist](/galleries/2015/12/29/weirdtwist.png)
![wellyno](/galleries/2015/12/29/wellyno.png)

NanoWriMo Final.

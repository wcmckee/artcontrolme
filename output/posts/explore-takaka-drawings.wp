<html><body><p>So I've been in Takaka for several days now, and drawing every one of these. It's been nice taking a break from Levin and being in a different setting.


Here's some of the artwork that I've done out and about in Takaka:<a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/DSC01728copy.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-656" title="DSC01728copy" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/DSC01728copy-767x1024.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="779"></a>



I drew this yesterday morning when up Pig Gully - my Uncle owns a mountain there. We drove up, giving the dogs a run. Once at the top I stood around for sometime before realizing there was a cold wind, and decided to get back in the car. This is a drawing of the view from the car. Sadly I didn't bring my green colored pencil with me so had to use yellow instead of green. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/DSC01737copy.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-657" title="DSC01737copy" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/DSC01737copy.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600"></a>



Another drawing from yesterday. This was in Takaka town district after I had lunch with a wonderful woman - Victoria Davis and her Mother (her mother is in a wheelchair and reminded me greatly of Nana). Lunch was delicious - I had a flat white, salad, and wedges. Great to catch up with Victoria and met her Mother.



After lunch Victoria headed off and I stayed in town. May as well enjoy the beautiful sunshine. I sat across from the building I had lunch - The Wheatmeal and drew the building. I love drawing buildings so much and I think i'm lucky to be able to document my trip with drawings rather then photographs. Drawings say much more then a photo ever will.

This is a view from the house I'm staying at. It was a beatiful sunny day so I decided to sit outside and draw the view. The hills are inspiring and this can only help my digital environments once I return to Levin. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/DSC01739copy.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-658" title="DSC01739copy" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/DSC01739copy.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600"></a>



I want to show a sense of scale - by drawing objects in the distance as well as the foreground.  Sitting on a bridge in the morning I drew this of the mountains in the distance. The blue is spose to be white, but putting some color into it made it feel finished.

<html><body><p>Currently sitting in the library in Levin. I took a bus down last night.
Before leaving I spend majority my time digital painting. Working from reference on GetsDrawn.

I've been finishing all three layers in the paintings, and getting several paintings complete a day.<a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/TheBeachWhale-line.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6112" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/TheBeachWhale-line-1024x723.png" alt="TheBeachWhale-line" width="788" height="556"></a>



 



TheBeachWhale line layer. Girl on the left, guy on the right. In the background is a landscape. Land mass emurge from the horizon. Below is water flowing the foreground. Clouds are spotted around the sky.

Grayscale tonal layer. Light for the skin, dark clothes. The horizon line upwards is medium dark with the water below light.

Colour tonal layer. Keeping with the usual colours. Yellow for skin, red for hair, blue for horizon line upwards.

Line layer. This is a rare one and I did no background landscape. The drap was interesting enough to drawn. I don't get to draw feet often either but for the I did. They are on the same level as the head.

Grayscale tonal. Light for the skin, dark for hair. I treated the cloth the same as landmass and made them dark.



<a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/nasa-line.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6107" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/nasa-line-1024x723.png" alt="nasa-line" width="788" height="556"></a>



Line layer. Guy on the left wearing a NASA tshirt. Girl on the right wearing glasses. Horizon line in the distance seprates the landmass above with the water below.  <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/nasa-bw.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6105" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/nasa-bw-1024x723.png" alt="nasa-bw" width="788" height="556"></a>



Tonal Grayscale. Toned back the background with less clutter than the line layer. Dark for hair and clouds. Light skin with medium shirt. Dark landmass and light water. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/nasa-color.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6106" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/nasa-color-1024x723.png" alt="nasa-color" width="788" height="556"></a>



 



Colour layer. Simple with red for the hair, yellow skin, and blue sky. Didn't bother with colour on shirt and water.

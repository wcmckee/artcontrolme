Pencil sketch to GIMP paintings. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/6923580708_1dda8f9810_o.gif"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-896" title="6923580708_1dda8f9810_o" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/6923580708_1dda8f9810_o.gif" alt="" width="800" height="1317"></a>Airport sketch thanks to <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Case_Studies/MiYoung_Yi_(Netstrolling)">Netscrolling</a>. Exploring areas of color further - what shapes can I make? <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/6923580708_1dda8f9810_o.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-897" title="6923580708_1dda8f9810_o" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/6923580708_1dda8f9810_o.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="1317"></a>Do the buildings and people need color. Maybe I could try a silver or grey on it. I've used grey somewhat in my other works - especially at the beginning stages of building a painting up.

Westfield. I want to take the majority of my pencil sketches into GIMP and develop these paintings. This can only help my knowledge of compossion and environments....<a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/jug110.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-901" title="jug110" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/jug110.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="1076"></a>The final painting. I guess I shouldn't really call it a final though. Because anyone is free to take my work and develop it on a new path. Just let me know :) <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/cat2small.gif"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898" title="cat2small" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/cat2small.gif" alt="" width="800" height="320"></a>A digital painting from several months ago. Decided to take it into GIMP and work over top using the same colors. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/cat2small.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-899" title="cat2small" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/cat2small.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="320"></a>I've been having a look over my older blog posts and noticed lots of life drawings that I could take though the digital stage. There is likely lots of life drawing work not uploaded - I should work on getting these uploaded as I can then turn them into digital paintings and such.</p></body></html>

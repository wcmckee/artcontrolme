<html><body><p>Hello.


It's been sometime since I've written on here. 3D and webdesign have taken up most of my time lately. I've been working in HTML5 - Canvas and Javascript, as well as Unity3d.



In terms of art for here though. My wonderful tablet is still broken. I need to get it sent away and fixed. I've been using my old small one. It does the job alright.



But anyway. I gotmyself a tablet, but sadly that broke this morning. Back to pen + paper I believe</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>Part two of reflecting back at some older paintings. These paintings were done around the same time as the previous post. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/3748.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-684" title="3748" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/3748-1024x768.png" alt="" width="584" height="438"></a>Last year I watched 5 seasons of the television show 'The Wire'. I never finished it off, maybe I should go back and finish it. Season one was the best. This is a portrait of two of the main cop characters from the show.

More oil paint. This started with referece of a much younger me, my nana and another photo of nana. It morphed and changed though the layers, turning into something ghostly.<a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/14646.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-681" title="14646" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/14646.png" alt="" width="800" height="533"></a>Acrylic painting on a Friday. These were some great exercises and I regret not spending more life drawing classes with paint. Working within a time limit for painting taught me a lot. I didn't have the time to think and ponder, or layer up a work. Working on brown paper was somewhat limited but it didn't stop me. Most of the time I worked with thin acrylic paint as it allowed it move quickly and create cool dripping effects. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/18881.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-682" title="18881" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/18881.png" alt="" width="800" height="600"></a>This was a longer pose - perhaps up to 30 mins. The model is clearly James - a model I had often when coming onsite to TLC. In this painting there are areas where I have drawn in with ink - I can see this with the blue lines that I used to create the shape. I filled it with paint to create the tone. This is how I worked often with colored pencil as well.

And a sitting pose. Plenty of grays are used in this with minimal color. I havn't started using my regular yellow for lights, reds for darks, and blue for negative color scheme in this - instead still exploring colors.

And finally a oil painting. This was a study of figures. I left this painting at my last flat in Wellington. To the left you can see part of the painting I did of my sisiter - from the previous blog post.</p></body></html>

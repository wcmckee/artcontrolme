<html><body><p>Back in the library today to write a blog post. I'll see how I feel after and hopefully get some code done also.


Here are two more digital paintings I completed before I left Hamilton:

Raniff line layer. In the reference the girl is holding a piece of paper that has a drawing of her on it.  Instead of a drawing of her on the line layer I added the <em>GetsDrawn </em>title and a landscape.

Grayscale tonal layer. Since the reference was a blonde I used light on the hair and medium on the skin. Landmass in the distance is dark, with a medium sky and light water.

Grayscale tonal Uroborus74 layer. Sorry I didn't include the line layer. It's sitting on my desktop computer in Hamilton.



For this the request was to be drawn like a character from the television show <em>Adventure Time</em>.<a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/uroboros74-color.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6122" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/uroboros74-color-1024x724.png" alt="uroboros74-color" width="788" height="557"></a>



 



Colour layer. Yellow is used for the skin and red for the hair. Blue for the shirt and sky. The landmass - a dark yellow and red. Aqua for the water.

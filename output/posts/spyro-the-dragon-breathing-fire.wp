Here's the painting -



<a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/spyro.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2303" alt="spyro" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/spyro.jpg" width="637" height="454">I</a> wanted to paint a scene from a early Spyro game rather than later. I found this screenshot from the first Spyro via Goggle Images.he's breathing fire which is what I wanted. A front view would of been cool - could always paint another!



Now onto the line - <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2315" alt="SPYRO-line" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/SPYRO-line1-1024x506.jpg" width="625" height="308">I started with the Spyro character first and sketched him in. Reference is so important for this - I was constantly looking to my 2nd monitor  Even with the reference in front of me, I get things wrong, but that's ok because it can be fixed during the black and white, and at worse - the color stage.



Some creative liberty was taken - such as a redesign of the enemy in the distance. It's the type of  character that I put into my pencil environments.

<a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/SPYRO-bw.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2294" alt="SPYRO-bw" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/SPYRO-bw-1024x506.jpg" width="625" height="308"></a>Ok tone.  Characters were the darkest, with the environment a mid gray. I used a very light (almost white gray) for the smoke effects. The brush I'm using is a new flat brush that I created from my stock photography. <a style="color: #0f3647" href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/SPYRO-line1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2313" alt="SPYRO-color" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/SPYRO-color1-1024x506.jpg" width="625" height="308"></a>Color. I didn't pixel pick this time, instead I looked at the color and guessed. I kept with similar colors for Spyro, the dragonfly, and the tents. Took liberty in other areas, such as the sky in the background and floor. Just to give it my own touch.



And finally, a demo video of the painting process:

No 3d models or game design was completed.

One of the first drawings completed for the project. For this I used Ruinjam environment artwork as reference.

Again reference inspired from ruinjam site. This included the jams mascot. This character is drawn and morphed into all concept art development.

This was drawn at Fairfield Community Centre. It is created with felt pens. On the right is a character from a book. Skin tone is yellow and background blue. The left is a humanold figure with wings. A child colored it in for me.

Landscape was added with red pen.

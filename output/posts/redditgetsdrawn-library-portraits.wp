<html><body><p>It's school holidays and I want to get my sleeping back on track so I've been hanging out in the youth center in the Library here in Levin. Using my cellphone as reference I drew several portraits from RedditGetsDrawn. I've also found my tablet pen so need to get back into digital painting. It's nice to put pencil to paper though. Today I'm planning on heading down to the local art center here in Levin. I need to hangout more with like minded individials - people that will answer more than 'yes' and 'thats great' when I discuss artwork with them.


There was the chance of me going to Wellington today, but I think I'd rather head to the art center.



Here's the results:

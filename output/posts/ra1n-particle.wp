It's been awhile since I've uploaded any Blender work. Last night and this morning I worked on a new scene with new models and textures. The ideas are much of the same as previous blender works - particle and lighting tests with minimal modeling. I did model out some basic shapes in order to have something to work with. A chair, table, and two models where objects.<a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/shot1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-496" title="shot1" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/shot1-1024x703.png" alt="" width="584" height="400"></a>

I'm not sure where to go with this work but I'll keep chugging along and hopefully get somewhere.

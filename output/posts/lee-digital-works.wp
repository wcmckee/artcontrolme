<html><body><p>Recent digital works - taking the life drawings I did on Friday and working over top on Photoshop. Matt painting was a focusÂ <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/kat.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-195" title="kat" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/kat-767x1024.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="779"></a>


This was a struggle in digital. I had problems finding lights and darks in the drawing - it was all a blur and didn't offer a strong contrast. I painted a very flat image - this could of been created in photoshop. Opacity is set to 100%. I attempted to layer but had problems.



I perfer the original oil pastel works. I looked at oil pastels in Frech Art Shop. Consided buying a white...... I need a part time job!

Layers have been used. I want to paint more like the old masters - I'm attempting that with the oil paints - Layering the paints up. This is much cheaper with digital paint than oil of course. White has been a large focus with over laying it onto the color.</p></body></html>

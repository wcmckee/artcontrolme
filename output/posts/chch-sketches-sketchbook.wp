<html><body><p>This is a selection of work from my Christchurch Sketchbook. I uploaded these works sometime ago but never posted all of them. It's helpful to have the images just sit in my server, wait for the day when I will use them in a post.


These works are created with imagination and one from photo reference.

My e-ticket. Copyed from my plane ticket for the flight from ChCh to Palmerston North. The rest of the page is figures and shapes created from imagination. The ideas were low-poly, cartoon characters.

This was drawn on the flight from ChCh to Palmy. The reference were fashion models from the Air New Zealand magazine. Sadly I didn't have a sharpener for my pencil and had to use colored pencil. With pencil I would of been able to focus on the detail, and tonal elements of the work.

Testing my new colored pencils I got from the Drawing room. I'm not partially happy with these pencils - I'd rather something less grainy. The shoe on the left is mine.<a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/28.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-697" title="28" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/28-673x1024.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="888"></a>



Shapes of character. Breaking it down into blocks. There are also some quick sketches of Brooke cooking dinner.

<html><body><p>I've really gotten back into SketchDaily on Reddit. They are having a month long Monster Girl theme happening... really motivates me to work on something everyday.


Here's the work so far. All painted in GIMP with my old Wacom CTE-440 tablet.

Experimenting with some different colors - most notable the purple. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/centeral1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1233" title="centeral" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/centeral1-1024x657.png" alt="" width="584" height="374"></a>Centaurs.Added in elements of my street drawings into this. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/skull1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1237" title="skull" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/skull1-1024x587.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="334"></a>Beautiful on the inside and Slime People. Inspirted by Da Vinci anatomy. Colors used tryed to convay slime. That yucky green/yellow.

Snake People. Noses. As you can see these creatures have a lack of noses. Inspired by a snake head (used a snake head as reference) then imaganation from there. Experimented with mixing colored together - red and blue to get the purple and a combo of yellow, red and blue to get the washed out red (background).

This wasn't for Sketch Daily but it was still painted for a Reddit user. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/EnPYT.jpg" rel="nofollow">I'd like to improve this doodle - think of those 6-7 year old kids, imagination overflowing, and having adventures everywhere...</a> Response I got for the work:

</p><blockquote> Thank you very much! (I already replied, but see it's not here - so sorry for the delay!) It reminds me of "Monkey's Island" for some reason :D



 </blockquote>

Being on a roll I decided to go do some painting on DeviantArt forum DrawPLZ. The user here asked for a Octopus.

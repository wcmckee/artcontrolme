<html><body><p>Just leaving IOGraph to do its thing. Some impressive and interesting works. Need to experiment with it in GIMP - colors... layers... would like to take these further into 3d.... textures.<a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IOGraphica-6-hours-from-18-07-May-3rd-to-0-41-May-4th.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-363" title="IOGraphica - 6 hours (from 18-07 May 3rd to 0-41 May 4th)" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IOGraphica-6-hours-from-18-07-May-3rd-to-0-41-May-4th-1024x572.png" alt="" width="584" height="326"></a><a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IOGraphica-1-days-from-10-49-May-1st-to-3-31-May-3rd.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-361" title="IOGraphica - 1 days (from 10-49 May 1st to 3-31 May 3rd)" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IOGraphica-1-days-from-10-49-May-1st-to-3-31-May-3rd-1024x570.png" alt="" width="584" height="325"></a><a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IOGraphica-1.5-days-from-10-49-May-1st-to-15-06-May-3rd.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-362" title="IOGraphica - 1.5 days (from 10-49 May 1st to 15-06 May 3rd)" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IOGraphica-1.5-days-from-10-49-May-1st-to-15-06-May-3rd-1024x571.png" alt="" width="584" height="325"></a>


Once the sun is out I'll take photos of life drawing from Friday and write a post. Plenty to say. More life drawing Monday... then for the rest of the week I'll work on creating models and textures within Blender. Should do some Java as well.</p></body></html>

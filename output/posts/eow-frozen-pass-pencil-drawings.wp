<html><body><p>Here's the drawings I did in my book for the EOW: Frozen Pass. My Brother saw these drawings in my book and said they were good so I have made an effect to upload them .


Continued with the idea from the digital paintings with a giant statue at the edge of a path and a group of people traveling along the edge. High above the ground the ice is cracking.



I'd like to take some of these ideas into 3d, work on a small open world area in Unity3d. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/DSC_3159.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-5467" alt="DSC_3159" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/DSC_3159-682x1024.jpg" width="584" height="876"></a>

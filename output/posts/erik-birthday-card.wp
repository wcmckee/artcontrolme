<html><body><p>During my time in Auckland I met Erik, he's a independent game developer based in Auckland. <a href="http://earok.net">Go check his website out</a>. I notice it's his birthday today so made this painting for him, similar to what I use to do with my Facebook friends before deleting Facebook earlier last year.


Anyway, I'll format this post like any other - first up line: <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/erik-birthday-line.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2183" alt="erik-birthday-line" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/erik-birthday-line-1024x512.jpg" width="625" height="312"></a> For the reference I used Eriks twitter picture. I had a quick look around his site for any higher res images I could use but no such luck. It doesn't matter though - still looks like him! Around the portrait I included balloons and cake plus the type: Happy Birthday Erik. Of course this was hand rendered.<a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/erik-birthday-tone.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2184" alt="erik-birthday-tone" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/erik-birthday-tone-1024x512.jpg" width="625" height="312"></a> Tone added. I choose to cover his skin first with black before later bringing lights over it. I've been thinking lately about working from a darker background rather than white. I've done this in the past and been happy with the result - it makes it feel less scary than a blank white canvas. <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/erik-birthday-color.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2185" alt="erik-birthday-color" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/erik-birthday-color-1024x512.jpg" width="625" height="312"></a>And finally color. I kept with just three color - yellow for skin, red for objects and blue for the background. I decided not to color the hat because I think black hats are rather rand.



Happy Birthday Erik - Hope you have a great day!</p></body></html>

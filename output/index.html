<p>Happy New Year! First post to the year. This selection of digital painting was mostly created at KiwiCon9. It was held in Wellington back in 
Decembers. It was the first time I attended and was a great experience. I went with my Raspberry Pi and Wacom drawing tablet. People were 
interested in it, from what I saw I was the only one walking around with a portable Raspberry Pi - and definitely the only one with a Wacom Drawing
Tablet. </p>
<p>Here we go. As always I will talk about each piece above:</p>
<p><img alt="ausmil" src="galleries/2016/01/19/ausmil.png"></p>
<p>Aussy Military. They had someone talk about the aus military and how it 
relates to security. </p>
<p><img alt="badusb" src="galleries/2016/01/19/badusb.png"></p>
<p>Fear and Loathing on your Desk: BadUSB, and what you should do about it.
Robery Fisk talked about the dangers of usb devices. I was lucky 
enough to meet Fisk the night before his talk at the VIP/speakers 
party. </p>
<p>I had meet one of his work mates at DevMob the week before and hanged out
with her during KiwiCon9.</p>
<p><img alt="bbcafe-line" src="galleries/2016/01/19/bbcafe-line.png"></p>
<p>An older work of sketching Raspberry Pi ideas. </p>
<p><img alt="cybervikinh-color" src="galleries/2016/01/19/cybervikinh-color.png"></p>
<p>Cyber Viking Cafe. Colour version. Not much words, mostly drawings of 
creatures and landscape.</p>
<p><img alt="cybervikinh-grayscale" src="galleries/2016/01/19/cybervikinh-grayscale.png"></p>
<p>The black and white version of Cyber Viking Cafe image. The colour version
always help define areas in the work.</p>
<p><img alt="iswhaat-line" src="galleries/2016/01/19/iswhaat-line.png"></p>
<p>Digital Painting from GetsDrawn of IsWhat.</p>
<p><img alt="itwillnotbemine3" src="galleries/2016/01/19/itwillnotbemine3.png"></p>
<p>Selection of days back in November of painting - mostly novel based 
sketches. </p>
<p><img alt="keynote" src="galleries/2016/01/19/keynote.png"></p>
<p>Keynote notes from KiwiCon. They had an event of the NSA swooping in and
arressting the speaker who was talking about xkeyscore.</p>
<p><img alt="kiwicon6" src="galleries/2016/01/19/kiwicon6.png"></p>
<p>Thursday after morning tea. Kate Pearce did a talk - stuff I mostly didn't
understand.</p>
<p>Wayne did a talk about red teaming which I found very entertaining and
informative. It was one of my favorite talks of the conference. </p>
<p><img alt="kiwicon7" src="galleries/2016/01/19/kiwicon7.png"></p>
<p>More notes on Waynes red teaming talk. The more interesting the talk is,
the more notes I write. </p>
<p>BORN TO SHELL</p>
<p><img alt="kiwiconstart" src="galleries/2016/01/19/kiwiconstart.png"></p>
<p>Kiwicon 9. CyberWar. Theate of War. Robotic sketches before the event 
started.</p>
<p><img alt="artykiwico" src="galleries/2016/01/19/partykiwicon.png"></p>
<p>This was the result of leaving my Pi setup on a talk at the VIP/Speaker
event at KiwiCon9. Had requests to change the colour to 'hot pink'. 
Several people had a go with the Wacom Drawing tablet. Gives me a break
from it!</p>
<p>That's a decent post for the start of the year. It is my goal this year
to keep this site more up to date with my artwork. I have the Raspberry
Pi portable device that I can use to make digital painting wherever I go
and write the blog posts using nano and then build the site with Nikola.</p>

<p>I have a Raspberry Pi setup for portable digital painting. It's a 
Raspberry Pi 2b with a 480x320px monitor attached to the GPIO slots. 
It's powered by a battery pack. A Wacom tablet is plugged into the 
USB on the Pi. GIMP is used for the painting and it has the same settings
as I had on the desktop. Now I can paint anywhere, no power needed!
Here's a collection of artwork that I have painted</p>
<p><img alt="bbcafe" src="galleries/2015/12/29/bbcafe.png"></p>
<p>Ideas for the Raspberry Pi internet cafe. </p>
<p><img alt="bbloj-color" src="galleries/2015/12/29/bbloj-color.png"></p>
<p>Colour logo for BroBeur CyberCafe. I added the line over the colour as 
it looked better than without it. </p>
<p><img alt="bbloj" src="galleries/2015/12/29/bbloj.png"></p>
<p>Grayscale BroBeur CyberCafe. Felt it didn't need the line layer.
Sorry, no line image. </p>
<p><img alt="bbpi" src="galleries/2015/12/29/bbpig.png"></p>
<p>Signinlca notes. Mostly writing but some drawing on the top left. </p>
<p><img alt="birds" src="galleries/2015/12/29/birds.png"></p>
<p>More character sketch ideas.</p>
<p><img alt="birthday" src="galleries/2015/12/29/birthday.png"></p>
<p>I went to a bar on the evening of my birthday and painted this there.
I found a corner and stayed in it. It was fun. </p>
<p><img alt="ccbrainwave" src="galleries/2015/12/29/ccbrainwave.png"></p>
<p>Creative Commons ideas mixed with NaNoWriMo stuff. </p>
<p><img alt="cyberwar" src="galleries/2015/12/29/cyberwar.png"></p>
<p>KiwiCon2015. This was created shortly before the kiwicon conference 
that I attended this year. </p>
<p><img alt="day12no" src="galleries/2015/12/29/day12no.png"></p>
<p>This was from Day12 of my NaNoWriMo sketching. During November I wrote
a 50,000 word novel and would carry my Pi with me sketching ideas and 
notes for the book.</p>
<p><img alt="day20no" src="galleries/2015/12/29/day20no.png"></p>
<p>Day 20 of NaNoWriMo. This was more of a summery of the book so far. </p>
<p><img alt="dayno" src="galleries/2015/12/29/dayno.png"></p>
<p>Writers Den Hamilton mixed with Creative Commons and Open Education 
Resources Sprints 2016. This is an event happening at the end of April
that involves creating education resources.</p>
<p><img alt="dayto" src="galleries/2015/12/29/dayton.png"></p>
<p>Another one from early this year. There are several drawings from local
Levin kids. They enjoy having a go with the drawing tablet - usually 
signing their name and creating basic drawings. </p>
<p><img alt="devmob" src="galleries/2015/12/29/devmob.png"></p>
<p>This is my spot. Some life drawing of the street - light pole and
building behind it. </p>
<p><img alt="devmobcc" src="galleries/2015/12/29/devmobcc.png"></p>
<p>DevMob2015 Creative Commons sketches. Ideas for logos, but got carried
away with characters.</p>
<p><img alt="old" src="galleries/2015/12/29/gold.png"></p>
<p>Golden Cloud. This was from early in the year. </p>
<p><img alt="hat-girl-bw" src="galleries/2015/12/29/hat-girl-bw.png"></p>
<p>Grayscale painting of a girl with a cool hat. </p>
<p><img alt="hatgirl" src="galleries/2015/12/29/hatgirl.png"></p>
<p>Line layer of the girl with a hat. Quite basic really. </p>
<p><img alt="monster" src="galleries/2015/12/29/monster.png"><img alt="robi" src="galleries/2015/12/29/robin.png"><img alt="supermarket" src="galleries/2015/12/29/supermarket.png"><img alt="weirdtwist" src="galleries/2015/12/29/weirdtwist.png"><img alt="wellyno" src="galleries/2015/12/29/wellyno.png"></p>
<p>NanoWriMo Final.</p>

<p>It's been sometime since I have updated this blog. For several months the site was down. I wrote code, I didn't really do much artwork. 
I think that has to change, so here is my attempt to my art blog running again. I've decided to not use the wp-content path for artwork
and instead use galleries. Don't worry - all the artwork that was in wp-content is still there. This only applies for future works.</p>
<p>I even wrote a script to help me create blog posts. It takes the images in a folder and creates a Markdown file out of them. It also
creates a year/month/day folder structure folder for the gallery. This is the same as I use for my GetsDrawn site.  </p>
<p>Anyway, here is a collection of digital paintings. Majority are from reference images on GetsDrawn. Enjoy - </p>
<p><img alt="LeahTHP-bw" src="galleries/2015/10/30/LeahTHP-bw.png"><img alt="LeahTHP-line" src="galleries/2015/10/30/LeahTHP-line.png"><img alt="SWEDEDOESMAKEUP-bw" src="galleries/2015/10/30/SWEDEDOESMAKEUP-bw.png"><img alt="SWEDEDOESMAKEUP-line" src="galleries/2015/10/30/SWEDEDOESMAKEUP-line.png"><img alt="_SEMPERRVIVUM-color" src="galleries/2015/10/30/_SEMPERRVIVUM-color.png"><img alt="_SEMPERRVIVUM-gratscale" src="galleries/2015/10/30/_SEMPERRVIVUM-gratscale.png"><img alt="_SEMPERRVIVUM-line" src="galleries/2015/10/30/_SEMPERRVIVUM-line.png"><img alt="bawkbawkmudder_udder-line" src="galleries/2015/10/30/bawkbawkmudder_udder-line.png"></p>
<h4>ItWillBeMine</h4>
<p>I have never draw the 'head mod' of RedditGetsDrawn but here it is. I was banned again for this. </p>
<p><img alt="iwbm-line" src="galleries/2015/10/30/iwbm-line.png"></p>
<h4>Jem ###</h4>
<p>It's rare that I do a remix of someone elses work. When I was at The Learning Connexion I remixed Cathrins work. This hasn't continued. 
I found this Wellington Artist <a href="http://jemshed.com/">Jem</a> and traced over her sketch. Similar process that I would do with my envrioment 
drawings, line layer to trace the pencil, followed by grayscale and colour layers. </p>
<p><img alt="jem-bw" src="galleries/2015/10/30/jem-bw.png"><img alt="jem-color" src="galleries/2015/10/30/jem-color.png"><img alt="jem-line" src="galleries/2015/10/30/jem-line.png"></p>
<h4>Kirsty</h4>
<p>This is a painting of my Friend Kirsty. They are wonderful and always let me stay at their place in Auckland. I enjoy going to tech conferences
and they are often held in Auckland, so this is quite often.</p>
<p>The reference was a beautiful photo of her taken on her 30th birthday. So you could say this was a birthday present for her! Happy 30th Kirsty :D</p>

<p>So it's been months since this blog has been updated. For several months it was shutdown. I was worried at one point that I had lost the 
art from the posts but I had backed it up on a Digital Ocean server. 
Since then the art has been restored but it's not linking correctly on artcontrol.me</p>
<p>I have decided to switch from the wp-contents folder structure to the galleries system that is default in Nikola. </p>
<p>Here are digital paintings that I have completed this month:</p>
<p>TheMilkCollective</p>

<p>The Raspberry Pi digital painting setup is stable. I have been able to walk and draw with it - though not as steady as sitting down or standing sill. Majority of the art is from imagination but some are landmarks and GetsDrawn.com</p>
<p>Enjoy - <a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/nychar-line.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6258" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/nychar-line-1024x724.png" alt="nychar-line" width="788" height="557"></a></p>
<p>Mixture of monster robotic characters and portraits from GetsDrawn. I've added their username near the portrait.</p>
<p><a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/artctrl-line.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6262" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/artctrl-line.png" alt="artctrl-line" width="1000" height="288"></a></p>
<p>It's been a long time since artcontrol.me: artwork of William Mckee has had a new logo. Using the Raspberry Pi and my Wacom tablet I traced over an old logo - to give it new life. This is the line layer. It's a little rough and quick, but the logo will cleanup on the grayscale tonal and color layers. I would never use a line layer as a logo.</p>
<p><a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/artctrl-bw.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6260" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/artctrl-bw.png" alt="artctrl-bw" width="1000" height="288"></a></p>
<p>Grayscale tonal. The R in artcontrol and the smaller text is a mess.</p>
<p><a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/artctrl-color.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6261" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/artctrl-color.png" alt="artctrl-color" width="1000" height="288"></a></p>
<p>Colour. Using Green on figure.</p>
<p><a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/hunt-line.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6259" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/hunt-line-1024x724.png" alt="hunt-line" width="788" height="557"></a></p>
<p>I will end with this. Red line layer. Characters for the gamejam Adventure Jam. It goes for two weeks. I'm not sure how much I'll get done - so far I've only produced paintings. The name of my game is <em>Hunt For Naples Yellow. </em>The name is inspired from the film <em>The Hunt For Red October </em>and named after my digital painting/python dev pi machine - naplesyellow.</p>
<p>Naming all servers after colours.</p>
<p>Crayons.</p>

<p>I have the Raspberry Pi 2 B setup with a touch screen monitor attached to the GPIO and my wacom drawing tablet (small) attached with USB. I have my GIMP settings setup so it hides everything. I just need to go into fullscreen and the painting covers the whole screen.</p>
<p>I hide the taskbar and just use right click on the tablet to get it back. This is much better use of the screen.</p>
<p>Grayscale and Colour tonal layers are posible but it's easier to just do the red line layer.</p>

<p>So after over a month I have finally got my Raspberry Pi 2 B setup and running. I had problems with the power supply - 5v 2a is needed but all my powersupply had low a.</p>
<p>The Pi is connected to a 17 inch monitor with a vga to html converter. GIMP is really all I am using it for. I have Raspberry Pi B+ with touch screen monitor attached that I use for reference photos.</p>
<p>Anyway here they are, a mixture of from imagaination and getsdrawn paintings.</p>
<p><a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/bambrosephoto-line.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6234" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/bambrosephoto-line-1024x724.png" alt="bambrosephoto-line" width="788" height="557"></a></p>
<p>Bombrosephoto line layer. Glasses holding camera. Minimal background landscape.</p>
<p><a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/bambrosephoto-bw.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6232" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/bambrosephoto-bw-1024x724.png" alt="bambrosephoto-bw" width="788" height="557"></a></p>
<p>Grayscale. Ignored the background and just focused on the portraits. Keeping it simple and minimal.</p>
<p><a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/bambrosephoto-color.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6233" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/bambrosephoto-color-1024x724.png" alt="bambrosephoto-color" width="788" height="557"></a></p>
<p>Colour. New purple (modifed the red) for glasses.</p>
<p><a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/deskand-line.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6236" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/deskand-line-1024x724.png" alt="deskand-line" width="788" height="557"></a></p>
<p>Raspberry Head creature with walking desk and monitor. Line layer. Pillars in background.</p>

<p>Grayscale. Spikes</p>
<p><a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/drawinpi-line.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6239" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/drawinpi-line-1024x724.png" alt="drawinpi-line" width="788" height="557"></a></p>
<p>Logos. Debian. Raspberry Pi. GetsDrawn. Just playing and getting use to tablet with pi</p>
<p><a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/drawinpi-bw.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6237" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/drawinpi-bw-1024x724.png" alt="drawinpi-bw" width="788" height="557"></a></p>
<p>Grayscale. The three logos again.</p>

<p>I spent several days in Christchurch recently but am now back in Levin.</p>
<p>Sadly I left my drawing book in Christchurch and have not drawn since.</p>
<p>When I was in Christchurch I did buy a new Raspberry Pi 2 B computer. I had it running Debian and was very impressed with the speed.</p>
<p>It is so fast that it allows me to do digital painting in GIMP just the same as on my desktop computer or laptop.</p>
<p>I don't have a monitor in Levin for the Pi so have not been able to do more - but here is what I created in Christchurch</p>
<p><a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/piart-line.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6224" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/piart-line-1024x724.png" alt="piart-line" width="788" height="557"></a></p>
<p>Pi Art. The term used by shop keeper when I picked up my new Pi. Testing marks and getting use to the Pi.</p>
<p><a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/laz-line.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6225" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/laz-line-1024x724.png" alt="laz-line" width="788" height="557"></a></p>
<p>On the Thursday in Christchurch I went to the Community Centre where I drew with someone. Taking some of these ideas from the drawings into GIMP.</p>
<p><a href="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/laz-grey.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6226" src="http://artcontrol.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/laz-grey-1024x724.png" alt="laz-grey" width="788" height="557"></a></p>
<p>Greyscale tonal layer.</p>
<p>Enjoy. It may be good for me to do some digital painting on the laptop. No monitor for the Pi currently.</p>

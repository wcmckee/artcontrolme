<p>Art created with my new Raspberry Pi touch screen and Wacom tablet. 
It is awesome but slightly annoying to carry around. I need a 3d printer to
print a case for it that would allow me to attach both the Wacom and Pi/Screen
to my body (perhaps my right arm). </p>
<p>Some interesting reactions on the street to the setup. As I was crossing a 
Hamilton bridge a young Maori woman walked past, 
saw my setup and spoke 'wtf is that' to her friend. It's no different
to an iPhone - it's only a computer at the end of the day. </p>
<p>Here's the art: </p>
<p><img alt="ccinschools" src="galleries/2016/02/29/ccinschools.png"></p>
<p>Matt made a post about the future of nzcommons so I was inspired to work on 
my fork of the site. It's a mess as I was working on a computer that was having
issues with dependencies of Python. I need to work on it on my main laptop (Dell)
which has no issues with dependencies. </p>
<p>I remixed elements of the 
<a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/ccinschools/">cc in schools</a>, including the 
Kiwi illustration. 
Comic started in the bottom left with the Kiwi speaking, 'Policies for 
Schools'.</p>
<p><img alt="introe" src="galleries/2016/02/29/introeng.png"></p>
<p>These are notes on a lecture that I attended for an Engineering paper. </p>
<p><img alt="kisslol" src="galleries/2016/02/29/kisslol.png"></p>
<p>FreezingOverHell getsdrawn portrait on the left and a remix of one of Jems 
comics. This was from a panel of her Sunshine comic. Hot. </p>
<p><img alt="sitwaits" src="galleries/2016/02/29/sitwaits.png"></p>
<p>Drawn walking around Hamilton. Just sketches of landscapes.</p>
<p><img alt="unigdraw" src="galleries/2016/02/29/unigdrawn.png"></p>
<p>Three portraits from getsdrawn. This of course breaks the 'don't draw multi 
people on the same page' rule, but I'm an expert at breaking getsdrawn rules. </p>
<p><img alt="writde" src="galleries/2016/02/29/writden.png"></p>
<p>WritersDenHamilton. I am happy with the current logo but maybe something 
with an illustration would be nice. Used the writers den Hamilton logo that 
the library uses to promote the group. They don't use my logo that
I made for the group. </p>
<p><img alt="xkcdba" src="galleries/2016/02/29/xkcdban.png"></p>
<p>xkcd banned from conference. I have yet to be banned from a conference but it's
something that could happen. Exciting. The original comic that I remixed from 
is <a href="https://xkcd.com/541/">xkcd: TED TALKS</a></p>

<p>I have a new monitor - the official 7 inch Raspberry Pi
touchscreen. It's a large upgrade - 480, 320px to 800, 480px. It is easier 
to work in with the larger screen. Everything fits. This has allowed me to 
work on grayscale paintings easier. When I was working on the small screen 
I was only producing line drawings. I am happy. </p>
<p>I have just spent a week down in Levin where I spent the majority of my time
reading or painting. I have downloaded a bunch of artwork from artist Jem 
Yoshioka and have been remixing it. You can find her work at <a href="http://jemshed.com">jemshed</a></p>
<p>I have also been reading a bunch of novels, this is thanks to the Kindle that 
I am borrowing from my brother. American Gods... Enjoy...</p>
<p><img alt="americangods-bw" src="galleries/2016/02/25/americangods-bw.png"></p>
<p>This was drawn after I finished reading American Gods. Reading the book 
gave me flashes of images that I was then able to paint. Of course my 
paintings look nothing like how I imagined. </p>
<p>This is the grayscale version and painted with the new 7 inch touch screen. 
Expect to see more grayscale layer and perhaps colour in the future.  </p>
<p><img alt="americangods-line" src="galleries/2016/02/25/americangods-line.png"></p>
<p>The line layer. The reference I used for this was a illustration of Jems 
for the bird. Everything else is imagination. </p>
<p><img alt="cotw" src="galleries/2016/02/25/cotw.png"></p>
<p>A portrait on the right and attempts on creature of the week. This is my 
Hello World with the new monitor. </p>
<p><img alt="jem-death" src="galleries/2016/02/25/jem-death.png"></p>
<p>More sketches inspired by Jems artwork. On Tuesday I visited my friend Justin
and  drew this. I had the reference on my old small monitor/pi. 
Having two portable touchscreen pis is handy but I need another two power packs. 
Currently I carry around two battery packs. This allows me to switch between
the two packs, and keep them both charged up at night. MORE POWER basically. </p>
<p>I love the unicorns. </p>
<p><img alt="jemcity-bw" src="galleries/2016/02/25/jemcity-bw.png"></p>
<p>I loved Jems painting of the girl looking out over the city rooftops.<br>
This grayscale layer took elements of her original. Areas 
have been re-imagined such as the horizon line (something I like to make up and
just doodle away with).  </p>
<p><img alt="jemcity-line" src="galleries/2016/02/25/jemcity-line.png"></p>
<p>The line layer. There were areas that I didn't complete in the grayscale layer,
such as the comic strip of the cracks in the earth (top right) and the face/
body of the Japanese woman. </p>
<p><img alt="jemcity-page-01" src="galleries/2016/02/25/jemcity-page-01.png"></p>
<p>This was a remix I did of Jems City comic strip. It's mostly all done by 
tracing over - cheating compared to using the artwork as reference like I did
on previous pieces. This stops me from remixing the piece so much, though 
I am tempted to redo these with more of a remix. </p>
<p>I love trees. </p>
<p><img alt="jemcity-page-02" src="galleries/2016/02/25/jemcity-page-02.png"></p>
<p>I stripped the borders off. The white space makes a nice border. </p>
<p><img alt="jemcity-page-03" src="galleries/2016/02/25/jemcity-page-03.png"></p>
<p>Where have I seen this before? That's right, Creative Commons ANZ used 
a remix of this for their  book. Go read it 
<a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2015/12/our-book-about-cc-in-nz-is-now-ready-to-read/">A Quiet Revolution: Growing Creative Commons in Aotearoa New Zealand</a>

<p>I have started reading Anansi Boys by Neil Gaiman so expect more artwork 
influenced by it. </p>

<p>I have a new touch screen for my Raspberry Pi. It's still the same size - 
480px by 320px but it is no longer cracked. The touch works! I still have 
my old touch screen and would like to find a use for it. Attaching it to 
somewhere that is useful - streaming cat gifs. </p>
<p>Here are some recent artworks created with GIMP:</p>
<p><img alt="drawn-pulpfic-bw" src="galleries/2016/02/19/gdrawn-pulpfic-bw.png"></p>
<p>It doesn't happen often but here is a grayscale tonal painting of 
PulpFictionDiction from getsdrawn. I like painting the text. I have 
croped this as the rest of the painting was blank.  </p>
<p><img alt="drawn-pulpfic" src="galleries/2016/02/19/gdrawn-pulpfic.png"></p>
<p>On the top left is the line layer of the previous painting. The rest of the 
image is sketches of robots and landscapes. Typical.</p>
<p><img alt="etsdraw" src="galleries/2016/02/19/getsdrawn.png"></p>
<p>This is sizeways as I had the Raspberry Pi hanging from my bed well I drew.
Some of the image is up the correct way - the landscape in the bottom left
looks correct. The text is not.</p>
<p><img alt="hamcompclub" src="galleries/2016/02/19/hamcompclub.png"></p>
<p>This was drawn at the Hamilton Computer Club. It was the Feb 2016 Thursday
meeting.  Sadly the meeting was spent sorting 'rules'. I guess it needed to
be sorted but I'm looking forward to speakers later on in the year. </p>
<p><img alt="hpug-ldo" src="galleries/2016/02/19/hpug-ldo.png"></p>
<p>This was drawn during the Hamilton Python User Group. Again this was the 
Feb 2016 meeting. Lorance did a talk on IPython/Jupyter Notebook. There 
was also much discussion regarding next months meeting. Next month I will
do a talk on Nikola.</p>
<p><img alt="lca16-start" src="galleries/2016/02/19/lca16-start.png"></p>
<p>I have been watching Linux Conf Aus videos on my laptop and painting them
as I watch them. It is certainly not the experience of being there, but 
the talk talks are informative. </p>
<p><img alt="monster-cake" src="galleries/2016/02/19/monster-cake.png"></p>
<p>No text, just drawing. Monsters, robots, and landscapes.</p>
<p><img alt="alace-begi" src="galleries/2016/02/19/palace-begin.png"></p>
<p>I use to be a big fan of the website conceptart.org especially
during my time at The Learning Connextion. It had been awhile 
since I had visited the site so I took a look. Enviortments on 
the week was always my favourite. The theme was Palace of Time. 
I need to visit the site regularly as it is great inspirion for 
drawing. </p>
<p><img alt="sleepslee" src="galleries/2016/02/19/sleepsleep.png"></p>
<p>several portraits draw from getsdrawn. isnipor and tklfota. </p>
<p><img alt="wacom-artist" src="galleries/2016/02/19/wacom-artist.png"></p>
<p>Illustation of my setup and a self portrait.</p>
<p><img alt="wdh-feb" src="galleries/2016/02/19/wdh-feb.png"></p>
<p>writers den notes during the meeting. I got there late but got
quite a bit of drawing completed. </p>
<p><img alt="wdh-romance" src="galleries/2016/02/19/wdh-romance.png"></p>
<p>The theme for the next Writers Den Hamilton is romance. It was 
my idea. I am not going to be at the next meeting but I've 
been thinking about the theme and have ideas. </p>
<p>This was drawn at the Sunday Den meeting, it was mostly sketching 
ideas for the romance theme. </p>
<p><img alt="write-ladder" src="galleries/2016/02/19/write-ladder.png"></p>
<p>Short story I started during the Wednesday Den meeting. The words 
on the left of the page are prompts given by each member. We were 
given ten minutes to come up with a story with the words. A points 
system was used but it didn't really work. Who's counting? </p>

<p>Another week, another conference. This week I got along to WCELfest. It's an
digital elearning conference held at Waikato University. </p>
<p>Here are the paintings that I created during the event:  </p>
<p><img alt="wcelfest-hello" src="galleries/2016/02/12/wcelfest-hello.png"></p>
<p>Drawing and note taking of the beginning of the conference including the keynote
speaker - Terry Anderson. It was an excellent keynote. I especially enjoyed him
talking about copyright and open access. There was no mention of Creative 
Commons, but I was actively tweeting with mentions of Creative Commons.</p>
<p><img alt="wcelfest-cyber" src="galleries/2016/02/12/wcelfest-cyber.png"></p>
<p>This was the final image of the day. I had grown tired after lunch with 
productivity dropping. Maybe I should of switched. I am use to going to 
conferences and sticking to the same room all week. Maybe they could of 
given the streams topic names?</p>
<p>One of the streams was workshop based which I wasn't interested in. The third
stream looked like they had some interesting stuff. But at the end of the day
it doesn't matter. I enjoyed myself and looking forward to watching the talks
online that I missed. </p>
<p>CYBER is hilarious. lulz when I heard the phase CYBER BULLY. Drinks a shot. 
CYBER was brought up again by the law dean as 
CYBER LAW. He was on a roll and rapped off a bunch of CYBER terms. Kiwicon
would of been proud. Finishes the bottle. </p>
<p><img alt="wcelfest-digitalbadge" src="galleries/2016/02/12/wcelfest-digitalbadge.png"></p>
<p>Digital Badge. When I saw the title of this talk I got excited, thinking they
were referring to LED based name tags but instead it was achievement points in 
a education course. </p>
<p><img alt="wcelfest-jones" src="galleries/2016/02/12/wcelfest-jones.png"></p>
<p>Welsh fella - Glyndwr Jones or JONES did a talk on blended classes. He was 
quite the character and funny. The painting lacks much drawing - only a sad
cat due to parking charges at Waikato University. </p>
<p><img alt="wcelfest-otago" src="galleries/2016/02/12/wcelfest-otago.png"></p>
<p>This was an interesting talk as the speakers talked about SCRUM development 
being
used for course development. It's normally used in software development and great
to see it's crossing areas. </p>

<p>I missed out on attending LCA2016 but was lucky enough to
make it to OWASP - a one day security conference. 
Like all the recent conferences I have attended I took in my Raspberry 
Pi and painted. The Pi was of interest,
getting questions when morning tea arrived.</p>
<p>The drawings from the day:</p>
<p><img alt="owasp16-bus" src="galleries/2016/02/05/owasp16-bus.png"></p>
<p>Leaving Hamilton early on the bus the majority of this was drawn on the 
trip to Auckland. It was a long bus trip - 3 hours. The traffic was bad 
but I arrived only ten minutes late. </p>
<p>Sitting up the back I noticed lots of people using Slack, which I was 
kind of surprised about. The first speaker - Dan Wallis talked about 
Credit Card Fraud. I drew him with a landscape in the background. </p>
<p><img alt="owasp16-crypto" src="galleries/2016/02/05/owasp16-crypto.png"></p>
<p>Crypto talk. This is interesting for me as I have played around with 
hashing passwords with Python a little. Something I would like to 
explore further. Not allot of drawing here - mostly sketching of words.
Though I have drawn the company logo - bug. </p>
<p><img alt="owasp16-foo" src="galleries/2016/02/05/owasp16-foo.png"></p>
<p>FooBlog. Exploring vulnerabilities in a blog. OAUTH2 
<img alt="owasp16-kaltura" src="galleries/2016/02/05/owasp16-kaltura.png"></p>
<p>A talk on Kaltura (an open source video platform). This was drawn in the
afternoon and I started to get too tired to do much at this point. </p>
<p><img alt="owasp16-morni" src="galleries/2016/02/05/owasp16-morning.png"></p>
<p>Full page of drawings. The mornings I always get lots drawn as I'm fresh.
Laura Bell had a bunch of images on her slides that I was able to draw. 
I like it when speakers have images on the slides as it gives me something
to draw. The only other stuff I can draw is the speaker or things around
the room (AV equipment etc). </p>
<p><img alt="owasp16-plane" src="galleries/2016/02/05/owasp16-plane.png"></p>
<p>The final drawing of the day. I give up.</p>
<p><img alt="owasp16-webrtc" src="galleries/2016/02/05/owasp16-webrtc.png"></p>
<p>A talk on WebRTC. Speaker was very entertaining. Draw a portrait of 
him and took a bunch of notes.</p>
<p>Till next year OWASP...</p>

<p>Happy New Year! First post to the year. This selection of digital painting was mostly created at KiwiCon9. It was held in Wellington back in 
Decembers. It was the first time I attended and was a great experience. I went with my Raspberry Pi and Wacom drawing tablet. People were 
interested in it, from what I saw I was the only one walking around with a portable Raspberry Pi - and definitely the only one with a Wacom Drawing
Tablet. </p>
<p>Here we go. As always I will talk about each piece above:</p>
<p><img alt="ausmil" src="galleries/2016/01/19/ausmil.png"></p>
<p>Aussy Military. They had someone talk about the aus military and how it 
relates to security. </p>
<p><img alt="badusb" src="galleries/2016/01/19/badusb.png"></p>
<p>Fear and Loathing on your Desk: BadUSB, and what you should do about it.
Robery Fisk talked about the dangers of usb devices. I was lucky 
enough to meet Fisk the night before his talk at the VIP/speakers 
party. </p>
<p>I had meet one of his work mates at DevMob the week before and hanged out
with her during KiwiCon9.</p>
<p><img alt="bbcafe-line" src="galleries/2016/01/19/bbcafe-line.png"></p>
<p>An older work of sketching Raspberry Pi ideas. </p>
<p><img alt="cybervikinh-color" src="galleries/2016/01/19/cybervikinh-color.png"></p>
<p>Cyber Viking Cafe. Colour version. Not much words, mostly drawings of 
creatures and landscape.</p>
<p><img alt="cybervikinh-grayscale" src="galleries/2016/01/19/cybervikinh-grayscale.png"></p>
<p>The black and white version of Cyber Viking Cafe image. The colour version
always help define areas in the work.</p>
<p><img alt="iswhaat-line" src="galleries/2016/01/19/iswhaat-line.png"></p>
<p>Digital Painting from GetsDrawn of IsWhat.</p>
<p><img alt="itwillnotbemine3" src="galleries/2016/01/19/itwillnotbemine3.png"></p>
<p>Selection of days back in November of painting - mostly novel based 
sketches. </p>
<p><img alt="keynote" src="galleries/2016/01/19/keynote.png"></p>
<p>Keynote notes from KiwiCon. They had an event of the NSA swooping in and
arressting the speaker who was talking about xkeyscore.</p>
<p><img alt="kiwicon6" src="galleries/2016/01/19/kiwicon6.png"></p>
<p>Thursday after morning tea. Kate Pearce did a talk - stuff I mostly didn't
understand.</p>
<p>Wayne did a talk about red teaming which I found very entertaining and
informative. It was one of my favorite talks of the conference. </p>
<p><img alt="kiwicon7" src="galleries/2016/01/19/kiwicon7.png"></p>
<p>More notes on Waynes red teaming talk. The more interesting the talk is,
the more notes I write. </p>
<p>BORN TO SHELL</p>
<p><img alt="kiwiconstart" src="galleries/2016/01/19/kiwiconstart.png"></p>
<p>Kiwicon 9. CyberWar. Theate of War. Robotic sketches before the event 
started.</p>
<p><img alt="artykiwico" src="galleries/2016/01/19/partykiwicon.png"></p>
<p>This was the result of leaving my Pi setup on a talk at the VIP/Speaker
event at KiwiCon9. Had requests to change the colour to 'hot pink'. 
Several people had a go with the Wacom Drawing tablet. Gives me a break
from it!</p>
<p>That's a decent post for the start of the year. It is my goal this year
to keep this site more up to date with my artwork. I have the Raspberry
Pi portable device that I can use to make digital painting wherever I go
and write the blog posts using nano and then build the site with Nikola.</p>

<p>I have a Raspberry Pi setup for portable digital painting. It's a 
Raspberry Pi 2b with a 480x320px monitor attached to the GPIO slots. 
It's powered by a battery pack. A Wacom tablet is plugged into the 
USB on the Pi. GIMP is used for the painting and it has the same settings
as I had on the desktop. Now I can paint anywhere, no power needed!
Here's a collection of artwork that I have painted</p>
<p><img alt="bbcafe" src="galleries/2015/12/29/bbcafe.png"></p>
<p>Ideas for the Raspberry Pi internet cafe. </p>
<p><img alt="bbloj-color" src="galleries/2015/12/29/bbloj-color.png"></p>
<p>Colour logo for BroBeur CyberCafe. I added the line over the colour as 
it looked better than without it. </p>
<p><img alt="bbloj" src="galleries/2015/12/29/bbloj.png"></p>
<p>Grayscale BroBeur CyberCafe. Felt it didn't need the line layer.
Sorry, no line image. </p>
<p><img alt="bbpi" src="galleries/2015/12/29/bbpig.png"></p>
<p>Signinlca notes. Mostly writing but some drawing on the top left. </p>
<p><img alt="birds" src="galleries/2015/12/29/birds.png"></p>
<p>More character sketch ideas.</p>
<p><img alt="birthday" src="galleries/2015/12/29/birthday.png"></p>
<p>I went to a bar on the evening of my birthday and painted this there.
I found a corner and stayed in it. It was fun. </p>
<p><img alt="ccbrainwave" src="galleries/2015/12/29/ccbrainwave.png"></p>
<p>Creative Commons ideas mixed with NaNoWriMo stuff. </p>
<p><img alt="cyberwar" src="galleries/2015/12/29/cyberwar.png"></p>
<p>KiwiCon2015. This was created shortly before the kiwicon conference 
that I attended this year. </p>
<p><img alt="day12no" src="galleries/2015/12/29/day12no.png"></p>
<p>This was from Day12 of my NaNoWriMo sketching. During November I wrote
a 50,000 word novel and would carry my Pi with me sketching ideas and 
notes for the book.</p>
<p><img alt="day20no" src="galleries/2015/12/29/day20no.png"></p>
<p>Day 20 of NaNoWriMo. This was more of a summery of the book so far. </p>
<p><img alt="dayno" src="galleries/2015/12/29/dayno.png"></p>
<p>Writers Den Hamilton mixed with Creative Commons and Open Education 
Resources Sprints 2016. This is an event happening at the end of April
that involves creating education resources.</p>
<p><img alt="dayto" src="galleries/2015/12/29/dayton.png"></p>
<p>Another one from early this year. There are several drawings from local
Levin kids. They enjoy having a go with the drawing tablet - usually 
signing their name and creating basic drawings. </p>
<p><img alt="devmob" src="galleries/2015/12/29/devmob.png"></p>
<p>This is my spot. Some life drawing of the street - light pole and
building behind it. </p>
<p><img alt="devmobcc" src="galleries/2015/12/29/devmobcc.png"></p>
<p>DevMob2015 Creative Commons sketches. Ideas for logos, but got carried
away with characters.</p>
<p><img alt="old" src="galleries/2015/12/29/gold.png"></p>
<p>Golden Cloud. This was from early in the year. </p>
<p><img alt="hat-girl-bw" src="galleries/2015/12/29/hat-girl-bw.png"></p>
<p>Grayscale painting of a girl with a cool hat. </p>
<p><img alt="hatgirl" src="galleries/2015/12/29/hatgirl.png"></p>
<p>Line layer of the girl with a hat. Quite basic really. </p>
<p><img alt="monster" src="galleries/2015/12/29/monster.png"><img alt="robi" src="galleries/2015/12/29/robin.png"><img alt="supermarket" src="galleries/2015/12/29/supermarket.png"><img alt="weirdtwist" src="galleries/2015/12/29/weirdtwist.png"><img alt="wellyno" src="galleries/2015/12/29/wellyno.png"></p>
<p>NanoWriMo Final.</p>

<p>It's been sometime since I have updated this blog. For several months the site was down. I wrote code, I didn't really do much artwork. 
I think that has to change, so here is my attempt to my art blog running again. I've decided to not use the wp-content path for artwork
and instead use galleries. Don't worry - all the artwork that was in wp-content is still there. This only applies for future works.</p>
<p>I even wrote a script to help me create blog posts. It takes the images in a folder and creates a Markdown file out of them. It also
creates a year/month/day folder structure folder for the gallery. This is the same as I use for my GetsDrawn site.  </p>
<p>Anyway, here is a collection of digital paintings. Majority are from reference images on GetsDrawn. Enjoy - </p>
<p><img alt="LeahTHP-bw" src="galleries/2015/10/30/LeahTHP-bw.png"><img alt="LeahTHP-line" src="galleries/2015/10/30/LeahTHP-line.png"><img alt="SWEDEDOESMAKEUP-bw" src="galleries/2015/10/30/SWEDEDOESMAKEUP-bw.png"><img alt="SWEDEDOESMAKEUP-line" src="galleries/2015/10/30/SWEDEDOESMAKEUP-line.png"><img alt="_SEMPERRVIVUM-color" src="galleries/2015/10/30/_SEMPERRVIVUM-color.png"><img alt="_SEMPERRVIVUM-gratscale" src="galleries/2015/10/30/_SEMPERRVIVUM-gratscale.png"><img alt="_SEMPERRVIVUM-line" src="galleries/2015/10/30/_SEMPERRVIVUM-line.png"><img alt="bawkbawkmudder_udder-line" src="galleries/2015/10/30/bawkbawkmudder_udder-line.png"></p>
<h4>ItWillBeMine</h4>
<p>I have never draw the 'head mod' of RedditGetsDrawn but here it is. I was banned again for this. </p>
<p><img alt="iwbm-line" src="galleries/2015/10/30/iwbm-line.png"></p>
<h4>Jem ###</h4>
<p>It's rare that I do a remix of someone elses work. When I was at The Learning Connexion I remixed Cathrins work. This hasn't continued. 
I found this Wellington Artist <a href="http://jemshed.com/">Jem</a> and traced over her sketch. Similar process that I would do with my envrioment 
drawings, line layer to trace the pencil, followed by grayscale and colour layers. </p>
<p><img alt="jem-bw" src="galleries/2015/10/30/jem-bw.png"><img alt="jem-color" src="galleries/2015/10/30/jem-color.png"><img alt="jem-line" src="galleries/2015/10/30/jem-line.png"></p>
<h4>Kirsty</h4>
<p>This is a painting of my Friend Kirsty. They are wonderful and always let me stay at their place in Auckland. I enjoy going to tech conferences
and they are often held in Auckland, so this is quite often.</p>
<p>The reference was a beautiful photo of her taken on her 30th birthday. So you could say this was a birthday present for her! Happy 30th Kirsty :D</p>

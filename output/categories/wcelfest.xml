This week I got along to WCELfest. It's an
digital elearning conference held at Waikato University. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the paintings that I created during the event:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="wcelfest-hello" src="http://artcontrol.me/galleries/2016/02/12/wcelfest-hello.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drawing and note taking of the beginning of the conference including the keynote
speaker - Terry Anderson. It was an excellent keynote. I especially enjoyed him
talking about copyright and open access. There was no mention of Creative 
Commons, but I was actively tweeting with mentions of Creative Commons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the final image of the day. I had grown tired after lunch with 
productivity dropping. Maybe I should of switched. I am use to going to 
conferences and sticking to the same room all week. Maybe they could of 
given the streams topic names?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the streams was workshop based which I wasn't interested in. The third
stream looked like they had some interesting stuff. But at the end of the day
it doesn't matter. I enjoyed myself and looking forward to watching the talks
online that I missed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CYBER is hilarious. lulz when I heard the phase CYBER BULLY. Drinks a shot. 
CYBER was brought up again by the law dean as 
CYBER LAW. He was on a roll and rapped off a bunch of CYBER terms. Kiwicon
would of been proud. Finishes the bottle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="wcelfest-digitalbadge" src="http://artcontrol.me/galleries/2016/02/12/wcelfest-digitalbadge.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digital Badge. When I saw the title of this talk I got excited, thinking they
were referring to LED based name tags but instead it was achievement points in 
a education course. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="wcelfest-jones" src="http://artcontrol.me/galleries/2016/02/12/wcelfest-jones.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welsh fella - Glyndwr Jones or JONES did a talk on blended classes. He was 
quite the character and funny. The painting lacks much drawing - only a sad
cat due to parking charges at Waikato University. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="wcelfest-otago" src="http://artcontrol.me/galleries/2016/02/12/wcelfest-otago.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was an interesting talk as the speakers talked about SCRUM development 
being
used for course development. It's normally used in software development and great
to see it's crossing areas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>digital painting</category><category>gimp</category><category>wcelfest</category><guid>http://artcontrol.me/posts/wcelfest16.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 11 Feb 2016 12:46:01 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>

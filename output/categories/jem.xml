touchscreen. It's a large upgrade - 480, 320px to 800, 480px. It is easier 
to work in with the larger screen. Everything fits. This has allowed me to 
work on grayscale paintings easier. When I was working on the small screen 
I was only producing line drawings. I am happy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have just spent a week down in Levin where I spent the majority of my time
reading or painting. I have downloaded a bunch of artwork from artist Jem 
Yoshioka and have been remixing it. You can find her work at &lt;a href="http://jemshed.com"&gt;jemshed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have also been reading a bunch of novels, this is thanks to the Kindle that 
I am borrowing from my brother. American Gods... Enjoy...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="americangods-bw" src="http://artcontrol.me/galleries/2016/02/25/americangods-bw.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was drawn after I finished reading American Gods. Reading the book 
gave me flashes of images that I was then able to paint. Of course my 
paintings look nothing like how I imagined. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the grayscale version and painted with the new 7 inch touch screen. 
Expect to see more grayscale layer and perhaps colour in the future.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="americangods-line" src="http://artcontrol.me/galleries/2016/02/25/americangods-line.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The line layer. The reference I used for this was a illustration of Jems 
for the bird. Everything else is imagination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="cotw" src="http://artcontrol.me/galleries/2016/02/25/cotw.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A portrait on the right and attempts on creature of the week. This is my 
Hello World with the new monitor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="jem-death" src="http://artcontrol.me/galleries/2016/02/25/jem-death.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More sketches inspired by Jems artwork. On Tuesday I visited my friend Justin
and  drew this. I had the reference on my old small monitor/pi. 
Having two portable touchscreen pis is handy but I need another two power packs. 
Currently I carry around two battery packs. This allows me to switch between
the two packs, and keep them both charged up at night. MORE POWER basically. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love the unicorns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="jemcity-bw" src="http://artcontrol.me/galleries/2016/02/25/jemcity-bw.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I loved Jems painting of the girl looking out over the city rooftops.&lt;br&gt;
This grayscale layer took elements of her original. Areas 
have been re-imagined such as the horizon line (something I like to make up and
just doodle away with).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="jemcity-line" src="http://artcontrol.me/galleries/2016/02/25/jemcity-line.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The line layer. There were areas that I didn't complete in the grayscale layer,
such as the comic strip of the cracks in the earth (top right) and the face/
body of the Japanese woman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="jemcity-page-01" src="http://artcontrol.me/galleries/2016/02/25/jemcity-page-01.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a remix I did of Jems City comic strip. It's mostly all done by 
tracing over - cheating compared to using the artwork as reference like I did
on previous pieces. This stops me from remixing the piece so much, though 
I am tempted to redo these with more of a remix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love trees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="jemcity-page-02" src="http://artcontrol.me/galleries/2016/02/25/jemcity-page-02.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stripped the borders off. The white space makes a nice border. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where have I seen this before? That's right, Creative Commons ANZ used 
a remix of this for their  book. Go read it

&lt;p&gt;I have started reading Anansi Boys by Neil Gaiman so expect more artwork 
influenced by it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>americangods</category><category>comic</category><category>gimp</category><category>jem</category><category>novel</category><guid>http://artcontrol.me/posts/american-gods-jem-city.html</guid><pubDate>Wed, 24 Feb 2016 12:46:01 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>

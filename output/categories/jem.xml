I am using the built in wifi, which is awesome. It is
faster than the pi2 which makes web browsing great as the pi2 will slightly sluggish when web 
browsing. 
I have yet to switch to a pi3 for my portable digital painting. I think I am going to keep with the
pi2 for now since the power usage on pi3 is quite high. I will use the pi3 as a desktop computer 
with the plan to get a touch screen for it in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is recent artwork. I have been remixing works from jemsshed, hicksville and xkcd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="about" src="http://artcontrol.me/galleries/2016/03/04/about.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About page I sketched. This is for my Nikola talk that will be happening on 14th March. If you
are in the Waikato come along! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="anansiboys" src="http://artcontrol.me/galleries/2016/03/04/anansiboys.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finished Anansi Boys by Neil Gaiman. It was excellent. I think I enjoyed it more than 
American Gods as I was more engaged. The story was excellent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="itwords" src="http://artcontrol.me/galleries/2016/03/04/gitwords.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was drawn at Writers Den Chartwell. It was only their 2nd meeting. There was an excellent turnout,
including 4 children. People talked about good writing, and bad writing, showing examples of both.
They also shared pieces of their writing based on the theme animals. The theme for next time is 
Mystery. I don't think I will make the next meeting as I am attending Ruby Camp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="hicksville" src="http://artcontrol.me/galleries/2016/03/04/hicksville.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was remixed from &lt;a href="http://hicksvillecomics.com"&gt;hicksvillecomics&lt;/a&gt;. I found this artist thanks 
to a list of artists on the Creative Commons website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="kurtmccarthy" src="http://artcontrol.me/galleries/2016/03/04/kurtmccarthy.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GetsDrawn portrait with sketches on the left. Included is a bottle of my brothers hot sauce. This 
was drawn when I was at my brothers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="musicback" src="http://artcontrol.me/galleries/2016/03/04/musicback.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another piece remixed from Hicksville.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="ikola" src="http://artcontrol.me/galleries/2016/03/04/nikola.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sketching my Nikola talk. This will be taken into Inkscape and converted into a vector file. Areas
will be split into a series of slides. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="rainstart" src="http://artcontrol.me/galleries/2016/03/04/rainstart.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have continued to remix Jemsshed artwork. This was inspired from her comic Rain. I did my 
own sketches for the rain, not using her rain illustrations as reference&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="wabbitcuddle" src="http://artcontrol.me/galleries/2016/03/04/wabbitcuddle.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another referece from Jemsshed this was of a rabbit and girl cuddling. Cute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="wander" src="http://artcontrol.me/galleries/2016/03/04/wander.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next panel of Rain. Merged several panels of Jems into one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="windwords" src="http://artcontrol.me/galleries/2016/03/04/windwords.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got bored and switched to xkcd reference. Lawrance was spose to do a talk on Git at the next 
wlug meeting. I am going to talk about the Raspberry Pi 3, not sure if he still is going to 
talk on Git.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A talk on licences would be great at wlug, something a bit difference. Creative Commons licences 
could be covererd. Would be great to get someone in to talk about it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="write-den-chartwell" src="http://artcontrol.me/galleries/2016/03/04/write-den-chartwell.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Final sketch. This was completed at Writers Den Chartwell. Notes at the bottom from discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the kids at writers den mentioned they have a list of jail words in their class - words that
they are not allowed to use. I am looking forward to seeing this list. It makes me what to write 
something that includes these words. Similar to the xkcd book What If?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>hicksville</category><category>jem</category><category>writersdenhamilton</category><guid>http://artcontrol.me/posts/wdc-hickville-jem.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 03 Mar 2016 15:46:01 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>american-gods-jem-city</title><link>http://artcontrol.me/posts/american-gods-jem-city.html</link><dc:creator>wcmckee</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have a new monitor - the official 7 inch Raspberry Pi
touchscreen. It's a large upgrade - 480, 320px to 800, 480px. It is easier 
to work in with the larger screen. Everything fits. This has allowed me to 
work on grayscale paintings easier. When I was working on the small screen 
I was only producing line drawings. I am happy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have just spent a week down in Levin where I spent the majority of my time
reading or painting. I have downloaded a bunch of artwork from artist Jem 
Yoshioka and have been remixing it. You can find her work at &lt;a href="http://jemshed.com"&gt;jemshed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have also been reading a bunch of novels, this is thanks to the Kindle that 
I am borrowing from my brother. American Gods... Enjoy...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="americangods-bw" src="http://artcontrol.me/galleries/2016/02/25/americangods-bw.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was drawn after I finished reading American Gods. Reading the book 
gave me flashes of images that I was then able to paint. Of course my 
paintings look nothing like how I imagined. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the grayscale version and painted with the new 7 inch touch screen. 
Expect to see more grayscale layer and perhaps colour in the future.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="americangods-line" src="http://artcontrol.me/galleries/2016/02/25/americangods-line.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The line layer. The reference I used for this was a illustration of Jems 
for the bird. Everything else is imagination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="cotw" src="http://artcontrol.me/galleries/2016/02/25/cotw.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A portrait on the right and attempts on creature of the week. This is my 
Hello World with the new monitor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="jem-death" src="http://artcontrol.me/galleries/2016/02/25/jem-death.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More sketches inspired by Jems artwork. On Tuesday I visited my friend Justin
and  drew this. I had the reference on my old small monitor/pi. 
Having two portable touchscreen pis is handy but I need another two power packs. 
Currently I carry around two battery packs. This allows me to switch between
the two packs, and keep them both charged up at night. MORE POWER basically. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love the unicorns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="jemcity-bw" src="http://artcontrol.me/galleries/2016/02/25/jemcity-bw.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I loved Jems painting of the girl looking out over the city rooftops.&lt;br&gt;
This grayscale layer took elements of her original. Areas 
have been re-imagined such as the horizon line (something I like to make up and
just doodle away with).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="jemcity-line" src="http://artcontrol.me/galleries/2016/02/25/jemcity-line.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The line layer. There were areas that I didn't complete in the grayscale layer,
such as the comic strip of the cracks in the earth (top right) and the face/
body of the Japanese woman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="jemcity-page-01" src="http://artcontrol.me/galleries/2016/02/25/jemcity-page-01.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a remix I did of Jems City comic strip. It's mostly all done by 
tracing over - cheating compared to using the artwork as reference like I did
on previous pieces. This stops me from remixing the piece so much, though 
I am tempted to redo these with more of a remix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love trees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="jemcity-page-02" src="http://artcontrol.me/galleries/2016/02/25/jemcity-page-02.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stripped the borders off. The white space makes a nice border. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="jemcity-page-03" src="http://artcontrol.me/galleries/2016/02/25/jemcity-page-03.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where have I seen this before? That's right, Creative Commons ANZ used 
a remix of this for their  book. Go read it 
&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2015/12/our-book-about-cc-in-nz-is-now-ready-to-read/"&gt;A Quiet Revolution: Growing Creative Commons in Aotearoa New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;img alt="yellowbird" src="http://artcontrol.me/galleries/2016/02/25/yellowbird.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have started reading Anansi Boys by Neil Gaiman so expect more artwork 
influenced by it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>americangods</category><category>comic</category><category>gimp</category><category>jem</category><category>novel</category><guid>http://artcontrol.me/posts/american-gods-jem-city.html</guid><pubDate>Wed, 24 Feb 2016 12:46:01 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>

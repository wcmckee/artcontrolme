First post to the year. This selection of digital painting was mostly created at KiwiCon9. It was held in Wellington back in 
Decembers. It was the first time I attended and was a great experience. I went with my Raspberry Pi and Wacom drawing tablet. People were 
interested in it, from what I saw I was the only one walking around with a portable Raspberry Pi - and definitely the only one with a Wacom Drawing
Tablet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we go. As always I will talk about each piece above:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="ausmil" src="http://artcontrol.me/galleries/2016/01/19/ausmil.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aussy Military. They had someone talk about the aus military and how it 
relates to security. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="badusb" src="http://artcontrol.me/galleries/2016/01/19/badusb.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fear and Loathing on your Desk: BadUSB, and what you should do about it.
Robery Fisk talked about the dangers of usb devices. I was lucky 
enough to meet Fisk the night before his talk at the VIP/speakers 
party. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had meet one of his work mates at DevMob the week before and hanged out
with her during KiwiCon9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="bbcafe-line" src="http://artcontrol.me/galleries/2016/01/19/bbcafe-line.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An older work of sketching Raspberry Pi ideas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="cybervikinh-color" src="http://artcontrol.me/galleries/2016/01/19/cybervikinh-color.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyber Viking Cafe. Colour version. Not much words, mostly drawings of 
creatures and landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="cybervikinh-grayscale" src="http://artcontrol.me/galleries/2016/01/19/cybervikinh-grayscale.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The black and white version of Cyber Viking Cafe image. The colour version
always help define areas in the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="iswhaat-line" src="http://artcontrol.me/galleries/2016/01/19/iswhaat-line.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digital Painting from GetsDrawn of IsWhat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="itwillnotbemine3" src="http://artcontrol.me/galleries/2016/01/19/itwillnotbemine3.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selection of days back in November of painting - mostly novel based 
sketches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="keynote" src="http://artcontrol.me/galleries/2016/01/19/keynote.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keynote notes from KiwiCon. They had an event of the NSA swooping in and
arressting the speaker who was talking about xkeyscore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="kiwicon6" src="http://artcontrol.me/galleries/2016/01/19/kiwicon6.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thursday after morning tea. Kate Pearce did a talk - stuff I mostly didn't
understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wayne did a talk about red teaming which I found very entertaining and
informative. It was one of my favorite talks of the conference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="kiwicon7" src="http://artcontrol.me/galleries/2016/01/19/kiwicon7.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More notes on Waynes red teaming talk. The more interesting the talk is,
the more notes I write. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BORN TO SHELL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="kiwiconstart" src="http://artcontrol.me/galleries/2016/01/19/kiwiconstart.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kiwicon 9. CyberWar. Theate of War. Robotic sketches before the event 
started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="artykiwico" src="http://artcontrol.me/galleries/2016/01/19/partykiwicon.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the result of leaving my Pi setup on a talk at the VIP/Speaker
event at KiwiCon9. Had requests to change the colour to 'hot pink'. 
Several people had a go with the Wacom Drawing tablet. Gives me a break
from it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's a decent post for the start of the year. It is my goal this year
to keep this site more up to date with my artwork. I have the Raspberry
Pi portable device that I can use to make digital painting wherever I go
and write the blog posts using nano and then build the site with Nikola.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>digital painting</category><category>gimp</category><category>kiwicon</category><guid>http://artcontrol.me/posts/artfor2016-01-19.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 18 Jan 2016 15:46:01 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
